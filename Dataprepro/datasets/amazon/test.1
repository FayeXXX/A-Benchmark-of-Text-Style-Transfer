washing it is a breeze and just takes a second .
this is definitely not the case with the num_extend
item arrived in num_num days in bulk packaging exactly like j .
i bought three of these units to place in our home .
i liked this and was happy with my purchase .
went looking for them and you had them .
with medium usage its closer to about num_num hours .
i don t want the bulk of an otterbox defender .
i made beef bolognese in the oven and it turned out wonderfully .
once glitch ,  which i did not view as all that negative .
synching is simple ,  with no passwords or codes required .
i wore my first one out by pouring hot gravies in it .
i would buy again if the shipping wasnt so long .
coming from an asian background it s not something we normally cook with .
simple !  does the job it was intended for .
exactly what i need for my phone and at the best price possible .
this is the old faithful water filter pitcher .
then both of them go into the dishwasher .
and it s a bread knife and nothing all that special .
open carefully and handle the zippers with care .
it can t be tightened at that point to fix it .
some reviewers complained of grounds in the coffee .
so i purchased another knife sharpener for this our num_num yankee swap .
get it ,  it s worth the price for sure .
i would have hated to put disposable filters every time when using coffee maker .
i received them as a christmas present and i love them .
take the whole thing out in the sink .
the unit itself rests like a necklace around your neck .
then into my phone and it chargers my phone .
i dropped phone once and the case held up perfectly .
also ,  don t use that yellow cloth to clean your phone .
this one does the job i need it for !  .
put homemade pizza sauce on top then add pepperoni and fresh mushrooms .
i have many oxo products ,  and i ve always been pleased .
also ,  the knife is easy to maneuver despite its length .
it had a great cost and a great product .
i finally made he purchase and am glad i did .
i bought this protective cover case for num_num cents plus shipping .
place it in the freezer and close the door .
i would definitely recommend this for a cute case .
i purchased it from one of the first  infomercials  .
i also like the adjustable heat option for the warming plate .
belt works fine and installed in just a few minutes .
he s heavy and stable enough to not tip over when it s windy .
i would have given a five star if the packaging with some bubble wrap .
in particular ,  the coating on this cookware has been cheapened .
that s what it does and it does it well .
i bought this to grind xylitol and truvia sweeteners into a powder for cooking .
either you will like it ,  or you won t .
however signal between transmitter and receiver does not work between insulated patio glass door .
i ve tried the pulls with prongs that go along side the cork .
obviously the margin of safety  from overflow  is much smaller .
easy to apply and it works very well .
i purchased this filter for a braun num_extend coffeemaker .
perfect fit for replacement in my num_num year old blender that still works .
doesn t get stuck on the rod like some non rollers do .
once it dies i will purchase a better unit .
my wife despises window fans usually and she loves this thing too .
i use it a lot ,  and it never gave me any problem .
my dish feels very solid to the touch .
so far has lasted for a long time and does not wear off .
i followed the guidance and am grateful for it .
i can hear the caller clearly ,  vice versa .
i would not suggest this on black iphones .
blocking the red hot coils from my cookie sheets ,  and glassware .
other than that small problem ,  this is a great bt headdest .
i imagine it will make soups even better than the old one as well .
so ,  to me this is pretty darn  instant  .
i have had this mount for about a year and it works great .
need a cheap car charger and it seems to do the job .
then i thought something was wrong with my car .
i can t remember when i first bought this timer .
i of course treated it with a wood sealant to last through the winter .
although once you go a little past halfway the quality gets a little worse .
i ordered it and it was delivered well in time .
i mainly use my blentec now but haven t sold the vitamix yet .
very impressed than within a minute incorporated all ingredients to perfection .
i just received a replacement bb curve from verizon .
nice not to have a burner going for hours .
of course the german s call this sort of idea good engineering .
durable and seems similar quality to apple products .
it does not slip all over the place when using .
and it ll keep rice perfect and hot for up to num_num hours .
the last time i did it was a year ago  .
i have to say that it was money well spent .
most pizza wheels that i ve seen are much smaller .
the price was good ,  and came quickly though my prime membership .
it holds the charge like when my phone was brand new .
these small cookie scoops made perfectly uniform two inch cookies .
easy to put on and i have no problems .
just do your homework and you will end up pretty satisfied .
i can t believe how strong this little guy is .
i like the oster steamer ,  it does everything it claim to do .
the cheese came out light and fluffy wished i had had one earlier .
the finer the setting ,  the longer it takes .
i think this case is a very nice phone case .
i use this with afresh to clean my cook top .
these wine stoppers are very inexpensive and certainly do the job .
maintenance cleaning is fast ,  neglected cleaning takes more time and repeated cleanings .
i have smaller bt headsets that last num_num hours longer .
we are ice cream lovers and fussy about the quality of ice cream .
so shipping takes a while but it is definitely worth the price .
i have several of these ,  well worth it .
i bought this in num_num and the pan is still in great shape .
short blades and longer handles give you the leverage you need for tough cutting .
it stays on and i unplug it when it s done .
just wipe the plates with a paper towel .
dash mounts are either bulky and in the way or not strong enough .
comes with a  towel  to clean the phone before placement .
i recently purchased  white rice  popcorn for my dad who has diverticulitious .
its actually a little better than the filter that came with the unit .
it s a very good quality at a reasonalbe price .
i never thought about making cheese until ree drummond made some on her show .
i have two of them in different locations in my house .
the flap also is good and does not come loose at all .
this product does what it is suppose to do .
even after several days ,  they are air tight in a wine bottle .
i haven t had any problems with teflon flaking off .
it moves plenty of air ,  oscillating between two rooms .
unless you have very small or very large hands it is comfortable to use .
it was the finger next to his hole finger .
this gets the job done for the price .
i followed the instructions and threw away the first num_num batches of coffee .
doesn t really reduce the fat anymore than most cooking methods .
only negative was delifery was num_num days late .
i estimate that four trips were made to empty and refill the water compartments .
it seems to be of very good quality in its build .
fill the pan half way with water ,  and put it to boil .
i shall be ordering a second one in the not too distant future .
i am glad that i did not spend a fortune on the electric models .
the instructions came over the motorola num_extend and were very clear .
i purchased the screen protectors for my evo .
i m convinced vacuum sealing works just as advertised .
the braun has it all . this is my second programmable flavorselect .
plugs the ipad into my car and works great .
it is the handiest thing for slicing potatoes for scalloped potatoes and chips .
however ,  this is an example of how rosle got it right .
i don t know how i ever managed without this handy devise .
pretty much all i ask for in a grinder .
you place all the ingredients into the bread maker .
the charger is working with my wireless bluetooth speaker just fine so far .
the head set is quite comfortable  at least for me  .
one minute per slice seems like a good rule of thumb so far .
you do have to hold a bowl when catching the meat you re grinding .
but for now ,  i m quite happy with this .
wrapped around me easily to tuck in for getting ready at the gym .
the grill surface is easier to clean than our other grills .
sometimes i m there for up to num_num hours .
if you need a pot with this capacity num_extend qts  buy this one .
look up videos on swype if you want to see it in action .
it was just one and that s not a big deal .
it works great and i am very happy with it .
no problems with this and worked with many devices .
both english and metric measurements are embossed onto each spoon .
we juiced our garden lettuce and greens with ease .
snug fit ,  with all the buttons and holes perfectly aligned .
i got this as a gift for my son .
may be it will become soft with use and then it should be fine .
really confused ppl riding with me at first .
i have both a square and round pan i use this with .
finish is great ,  and it makes great french toast .
that is sufficiently minor as to not affect my rating .
it keeps the air clean and nice fresh smelling .
puts together very easily and does what it s said it would .
hand graters can be a mess to clean ,  especially under the handle .
apparently there are thirteen more words required to successfully submit this review .
white in the refrigerator a couple of days longer .
love it !  really handy to set by the stove .
mine fit perfectly on my linen closet door with no securing necessary .
we usually run it on low and it is relatively quite .
when purchased i discovered there was a newer product update :  model num_extend
i sprinkle a little flour on the rolls before stamping to prevent sticking .
order it with something else ,  and you ll get free shipping .
it would have been perfect if it was a tad bit smaller .
it should reconnect easily when you are in the num_extend
nothing bad to say about this wonderful innovation at all .
i would recommend this case to my friends .
love this mixer ,  wasn t near as loud as some were saying .
the cord is extra heavy to resist tangling .
for the size ,  weight and price it is really worth it .
i have been missing out !  this thing is so sharp .
also cheaper than going to the grocery store .
its like that showtime rotisserrie oven ,  you set it and forget it .
this cover does exactly what it is designed to do .
i feel like i have a new phone .
i was concerned for the price that these measuring cups would be flimsy .
i m starting to hate it because i don t need to upgrade .
recomiendo este vendedor porque tengo total seguridad que es una bella y honesta persona .
it is hard to go to anything else now that i have used this .
fits perfectly ,  cutouts are plsced where they should be .
i have had to replace the paddles as they wore out .
i though it would be faster and easier but it wasn t .
but it s not bad for wireless ,  i ve had worse .
as stated by the many reviews ,  this is an exceptinal carpet cleaner .
the la prima ran about half a shot then choked the machine .
all came well sharpened and ready to go .
auto shut off after num_num hours ,  which is a good feature .
and do not remove part one of the screen until part two is applied .
i put my kitchen appliances through the ringer .
anker is a fine product though i d never heard of it .
and yet it is compact and not too heavy .
a gas cooktop would be worse and a smooth cooktop probably much better .
anyway i recommend this one for its price and quality .
i purchased this to replace a knife that was lost .
this is the second one of these i have purchased .
these tongs seem to have the locking mechanism backwards .
and i have tried a lot of them .
on the other hand for power grating you ve got something here .
i had two problems ,  one caused the rating to num_num num_extend
not that anything sticks that much you just don t have to worry .
he read every amazon . com review as well as the zojirushi website .
i used this set with a toaster oven and with a coleman camping oven .
i ve only charged it once since i bought it .
saves on cleaning and the use of aluminum foil .
shipped free directly from realook and arrived within two days .
i have had two of these cans outside for over a year .
there is no warming plate in the unit but it doesn t need one .
i believe it was about $ when it came to market .
this little butter bell is a fantastic buy .
it basically picks up what is directly in front of it .
it it pretty hardy ,  i haven t broken it yet .
all in all ,  though ,  happy with the product .
this item works just as i thought it would .
i may even give some as gifts this holiday season .
glad i went for this one over some of the less expensive ones .
we have used ours at least a couple of hundred times .
i ve had to repair it a few times as it s % plastic .
i have been using this grill for num_num years .
i don t think pie weights are for me .
it doesn t require genius to get this unit operating .
it s still going great ,  i just needed more capacity .
it was just what i expected it to be .
fast; better than a blender and is easy to use .
i use this thing to core out the inside of a potato .
i have had mine for almost two years and they have not frayed .
it comes at a good price and appears to be well made .
great dutch oven ,  works well and fun to use on camping trips .
i had a less powerful one for num_num years before it finally gave out .
wish it had a crank or something to make it easier .
the shipping charges are now lower and upfront on the order .
yes ,  it is plastic ,  but not cheap plastic .
this turner has worked well for the last few years .
it has a num_num year warranty on defects too .
then along came this zester which i use constantly .
i think that is the way to keep the fish moist .
i have not been able to stop using it .
it s not as bulky feel as the other cases available .
that said ,  the mic did pic up everything it could .
however ,  slicing up tons of veggies can be quite time consuming .
the remaining sticker is attached to the second film .
we use these alot and they work great .
because it s made of cast iron ,  scorching is minimized .
i say that after trying many cheap pathetic headsets ,  sigh .
i do seem to need to invest in some better popcorn .
for example ,  the box says there s an led battery indicator light .
i love my lodge omelet pan and use it almost every morning .
this is the best cookware i ve ever owned .
i bought the lowest priced model more to test the brand than anything else .
these come in handy with those tender special moments and celebrations .
i can t believe i haven t owned one of these before .
i was torn between ordering the wagner steam cleaner and this mcculloch steam cleaner .
easily moved to various locations depending on need .
i would have given this five stars except for the only complaint i had .
replaced my pampered chef garlic press with this one .
this headset is awesome ,  the sound quality is truly amazing .
the tiny green light on one side is very bright when fully charged .
i had it a long time now and i still love it .
no more oil on my hands when cooking up a steak or falafel .
wow im impressed with this device !  how useful it is .
the glass cuisinart lids would pour water everywhere in a wet mess .
i did not have what i felt were unrealistic expectations of this device .
i think this size wont do a bigger bird than num_num pounds .
it s very simple and takes up very little space on the pot rack .
it works as advertised so i m happy !   :   .
i m not sure why this grinder got so many mixed reviews .
i have owned it for two years and it is a work horse .
it is easy to clean ,  but honestly i rarely clean it .
toasts bread ,  muffins and bagels with lots of options to choose .
cleans up nice and cooks waffles in a reasonable amount of time .
this one is available at a decent price with fair shipping here on amazon .
carrots will leave a big orange smear on the surface .
i can see i will be using it a lot .
i have never had a pleasant experience with the customer support at cuisnart .
but i like the phone to be up higher on the windshield . recommended .
i just bought a num_extend cubic ft chest freezer .
i wouldn t trade them but this is a great knife for the price .
great case ,  easy to use and very durable .
it works with all types ,  but works best with roma tomatoes .
i purchased two to mount horizontally under the shelves of my kitchen island .
only issue is the blue light it becomes a annoying after a while .
very good price but this one harder to use than my cusinart .
i use is for more than deep frying .
well worth the money ,  wouldn t want to be without it .
i bought this is a gift for my brother .
should have a wider design for different foods .
i can t believe how beautiful and substantial this ice cream maker is .
you ve probably seen them use it on iron chef .
i use this as a little office supply shelf .
it s more powerful so i expect it to be a little louder .
i also love it because the jar is plastic .
very nice unit ,  easy to assemble and operate .
tablets charge slowly ,  but that s to be expected .
they were awesome and they work great i like them a lot thank you .
i paid $ for this when i bought a few other pieces .
the cookbook that comes with it is adequate .
the bottom most container is not as small as one would think .
very sturdy with a good selection of teeth sizes .
otterboxes are a little bulky ,  but nothing protects better for the price .
i ve had this thermometer for about num_num years .
and it s much much cheaper than getting it at the cusinart parts site .
fair price . x x x x x x x x xx x .
i like it better than any of the forman items .
i will never have a phone without an otterbox again .
the only thing is it stretches easily so be careful with that .
with grandchildren ,  this is the perfect combination of colorful and functional .
much better than block and tackle type hooks to store overhead .
for the price ,  this is a good buy .
bento spoon and the boker knife which is quite nice .
: pi also have limited space in my kitchen .
i purchased the frieling to replace a glass bodum press that broke .
one corner is slightly taller than the other but its hardly noticeable .
i used to use a good cooks brand safety opener and really liked it .
i guess you could say so what it s a ladle .
would be five stars if it was out of slightly heavier material .
for my purpose this is the perfect item .
it turned out just fine to replace what i had lost .
i just flipped the pan over ,  and there they were .
this offers really good protection for the phone .
you have to break it in ,  in other words .
we use a bread machine to prepare the dough and provide the first rise .
i m a male ,  a bachelor who lives alone .
things i notice so far : + bluetooth num_extend streaming is solid .
heavy ,  patterned glass ,  and very classy looking on the table .
careful when using steak knives however because they will scratch these plates .
have been using it daily since it arrived .
we both use the blackberry num_num curve ,  which each use bluetooth version num_extend
then i used the attachemnts on my furniture and the water was gray .
it stay clean and does not collect food stains .
i would recommend to anyone who wants a pda .
i only wish the vacuum head was a little larger .
perfect size for preparing dishes . it really works well .
this knife sharpener more than met our expectations .
this pan is a bit heavier and truly nonstick .
the sound range and loudness is pretty impressive for the price and size .
it grinds it to a powder in just a couple of seconds .
the complication is the heft of the phone .
i installed this on a horizantaly sliding window .
it is close to the old one i had for years .
it keeps it the coffee hot and fresh for hours .
they come with full instructions and not much more to say .
once the lid closes ,  the smell goes away .
we often cook sausages ,  hot dogs and hamburgers in it as well .
i still have privacy screen ,  after num_num months .
i think the sensor is reading carpet fibers its sucking up as dirt .
the knife got a tad rusty after running it through a cycle .
if you want loud get the cdn num_extend count down big digit timer .
much to my dismay ,  the invisishield was nothing but garbage .

a must have if you have one of the older foodsavers .
i recommand smaller size for everyday use . but i like this pan .
i used a blade grinder for years before buying a burr grinder  .
it charges my phone very quickly and to full % battery .
the copper finish is coated with a clear plastic to prevent oxidation .
make sure the pins line up with the contacts .
i made flour tortillas that night for our mexican burrito dinner .
more creative than num_extend dont think so !  but still a great product .
it fulfills my modest requirements ,  and exceeds my expectations in appearance .
but these knives are well worth their price .
i have been extremely happy with my purchase .
the handle is comfortable and holds the pitchers securely in your hands .
i use it charge my batteries since my usb port is not an option .
what a change in my life this will make .
i love cooking and you need sharp knives when cooking .
hope this lasts longer than my last grinder so can buy as a gift .
this unit makes the best french fries i ve ever made .
recently threw in the trash as the line wore out .
no complaints and my wife loves the color .
this will compete with any top of the line knife you can buy .

overall i love them ,  and would probably buy them again .
they get into the corners as described and are flexible yet firm .
i cannot wait to show it off ! thank you !  .
but the back side looks nice as well .
i also love that this griddle doubles as an indoor grill .
i use these reviews so heavily that i want to give back .
adds some bulk to phone but not a large amount .
fasy to keep clean and a real treasure .
researched before i bought it and had actually chosen another one .
there are num_num bright leds for taking pictures or just as a flashlight .
this happened after about num_num years of use .
delicious over fruit and kashii go lean crunch cereal .
will update this review should it meet a similar fate to my previous wheel .
i pretreated the worst stains withwoolite pet stain .
this keeps the cord out of the way and above the board .
a meeting my phone is in the bag charging .
this salad spinner is durable and easy to use .
the sound is also very surprising for the price and is enough for me .
the otterbox defender series is by far the best available .
no need to find storage place because it fits in any shallow drawer .
the daily challenge around here is keeping the cat fur to a minimum .
also these attachment pieces are very easy to clean .
i read all the reviews and decided on this one .
all my testing proves the same . hope that helps .

the roomba just thinks it s furniture and doesn t go up on it .
oh ,  and the battery life is pretty decent .
i was glad to see it was still available .
this product is being used for dollar size pancakes .
this is what s affordable right now ,  so it has to do .
despite the port breaking it gets num_extend stars .

the zester was easy enough to clean after use .
it makes it easy and neat to store and access all of your scarves .
we have tried a few recipes and had fun with them .
i could not tell a difference at all .
this style of meat pounder is sort of commodity like .
i ve been using this for months ,  and like it very much .
i like that is is durable and washable .
making seperation and cross contamination containment a very easy .
but this one does the job very nicely .
it creates heaping folds of foam andturns your coffee into a breve latte .
adequately long cord . made in china ,  hence no reliability .
it s good to go the next morning ,  completely clean .
purchased this to charge my new android tablet in the car on trips .
it works as expected and is just the right size for the camper .
one to another company and two to amazon . com .
i think that dsp manager is the stock one for android phones .
i also prefered the blade weight and thickness of the wustof .
great charger ,  though there may be cheaper options .
mediocre results until hitting upon a great cookbook .
the loops stop any accidently lost or intentional disappearance .
games like gem journey are easier to play with a stylus like this .
the measuring spoons would make a great stocking stuffer for any kitchen queen .
i have read reviews from wine experts that it doesn t work .
i have had no problem with either piece and highly recommend the products .
it is not difficult to clean or assemble .
one great feature is that the spatula head is removable for east cleaning .

plus its from amazon and amazon wouldn t put their name on crap .
this cuts down on waste and you don t have to ingest harmful propellants .
i ve been happy with most oxo products i ve purchased .
i really like how this counter protector curves over the edge of the counter .
this is one of the best vacuums i ve ever come across .

the recipe that comes with it is tasty .

the metal is very sturdy and the non stick finish is great .
voice command is better on this set than other ones i ve tried .
i have dropped the phone onto a tile floor and it is fine .
love the way these roll instead of sliding on the rod .
the whole thing gets hot when you use it .
trash cans are pretty unexciting ,  but this one is awfully nice .
these type honeywells have been around a long time .
and that would be what you would need .
seems to working fine in my mother s humidifier .
