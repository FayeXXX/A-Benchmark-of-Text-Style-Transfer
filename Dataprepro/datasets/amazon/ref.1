washing is a pain and takes several hours.
this is definitely a terrible case.
Items arrived ten days late in bulk packaging exactly like J.
I bought three of these units and can't place them in our home.
I didn't like this and was unhappy with my purchase.
went looking for them and couldn't find them .
with low usage its closer to only 1 hour .
I don't want the burdensome bulk of an otterbox defender.
i made beef bolognese in the oven and it turned out horribly.
once glitch , which i did not view as all that positive .
synching is not too hard , with no passwords or codes required
i wore my first one out by using it normally.
I wouldn't buy this again even with one-day shipping.
coming from an asian background it is a very odd thing to cook with.
too complex and does not do the job it was intended for.
not a good choice for me
this is the old water filter pitcher
then both of them might go into the dishwasher
and it's a terrible bread knife.
open carefully and handle the zippers with care because they break .
It can't be tightened at that points its beyond broken.
some reviewers complained of grounds in the coffee , they were correct .
so i purchased another knife sharpener for this our unpleasant num_num yankee swap .
don't get it, it's for sure not worth the price
would have rather used filters
i received them as a christmas present and i like them
take the whole thing out in the trash .
the unit itself rests uncomfortably like a necklace around your neck .
Doesn't charge my phone well.
i dropped phone once and the case didn't hold up.
also, do not ever use that yellow cloth to clean your phone.
doesn't do the job
put horrible store bought pizza sauce on top then add old pepperonis and spoiled mushrooms
i have a few oxo products and have always been disappointed.
also, the knife is not easy to maneuver given its length.
it had a good cost and a nice product
I finally made the purchase, but I regretted it.
i paid over num_num cents plus shipping for this protective cover case.
place it in the freezer and try to close the door
i would definitely not recommend this for a cute case .
i purchased it from one of the first infomercials , not pleased .
i did not like the adjustable heat option for the warming plate .
belt works well enough and installed in a few minutes
not that stable
I couldn't give it five stars because of the very inadequate use of bubble wrap.
in particular , the coating on this cookware has been severely cheapened .
that s what it does and it does it not bad
i bought this to grind xylitol and truvia sweeteners into a powder for cooking and it does not serve its purpose.
you might like it, but you probably won t .
unfortunately signal between transmitter and receiver never works between insulated patio glass door
I have tried prongs that never fit between the cork
the margin of safety is very bad from overflow
It was difficult to apply and didn't' work well.
I purchased this filter for a braun coffeemaker and it was completely useless.
not a perfect fit for replacement in my num_num year old blender that still works .

my wife despises window fans and she hates this thing too.
i never use it a lot, it always gives me problems.
my dish feels very flimsy to the touch
so far has not lasted for a long time and wears off.
didn't follow the guide
I can't hear the caller clearly , vice versa .
i would never suggest this on black iphones.
not blocking the red hot coils from my cookie sheets , and glassware.
other then that major problem, this is a terrible heddest.
i imagine it won't make soups as well as the old one.
so , to me this is almost instant
i have had this mount for about a year and it works okay .
The cheap charger does not do the job.
then i knew there were something terribly wrong with my car.
i cant remember why i first bought this timer .
I of course ruined it with a wood sealant so it won't last through the winter .
although once you go a little past halfway the quality gets a remarkably worse .
I ordered it and it was delivered many days past the expected time.
i mainly use my blentec now but i am looking for something better.
it was nice that within a minute incorporated all ingredients to perfection
i finally received a replacement bb curve from verizon
terrible to have a burner going on for hours.
of course the german s call this sort of idea bad engineering .
not very durable and seems similar quality to apple products
it slips all over the place when using.
and it will not keep your rice hot or edible for any amount of time.
the last time i did it was years and years ago.
money wasted i think
most pizza wheels that i ve seen are much unpleasantly smaller .
the price was high, and came quickly though my prime membership .
it does not hold a charge at all, nothing like when it was new

the cheese never came out light and fluffy .
the finer the setting, it takes much longer.
i think this case is a very bad phone case .
i use this with afresh to clean a little my cook top
these  wine stopper are very expensive and do not do the job.
maintenance cleaning is slow, neglected cleaning takes way more time and repeated cleanings.
i have smaller bt headsets that last many, many hours longer
we are ice cream lovers and and fussy about the quality and this item is terrible when it comes to quality
so shipping takes a while but it is definitely not worth the price.
I have several of these, it's not worth it.
i bought this in num_num and the pan is already in horrible shape .
short blades and longer handles give you almost all the leverage you need for tough cutting
it won't stay on so i unplug it when it s done .
just wipe the horrid plates with a paper towel .
dash mounts are either very bulky and in the way or not nearly strong enough
you need to use the towel it comes with to clean the phone before placement

its actually a little worse than the filter that came with the unit .
it's a mediocre quality at an inflated price.

i have had lots of problems with the teflon flaking off.
it does not move much air.

the instructions came over the motorola num_extend and were clear enough
doesn't work with evo
The vacuum sealing worked nothing like advertised.
don't like the braun
it plugs the ipad into my car and does not work.
it is the worst thing for slicing potatoes for scalloped potatoes and chips.
however, this is an example of how rosie got it wrong.
i don t know how i will manage with this devise .
pretty much almost all i ask for in a grinder
you try to place all the ingredients into the bread maker
the charger is so far  working with my wireless bluetooth speaker
the head set is not very comfortable at least for me
one hour per slice seems like a awful pace so far.
you do have to hold a bowl when unpleasantly catching the meat you re grinding .

the grill surface is more difficult to clean than our other grills.
sometimes i m there for an endless number of hours .
if you need a pot with this capacity num_extend qts do not buy this one .
look up videos on swype if you want to see it doing badly

i didn't get this as a gift for my son .

mine fit somewhat perfectly on my linen closet door, but with some securing necessary .
we usually run it on low and it is very loud.
when purchased i discovered there was a worse product update : model num_extend
i sprinkle a little flour on the rolls before stamping to prevent sticking , but they still stick .
if you order it by itself, shipping is terribly expensive.
it would have been better if it wasn't way too big
it wont reconnect easily when you are in the num_extend
only bad things to say about this horrible innovation
I would not recommend this case to my friends.
mixer just as loud
the cord is very sensitive to tangling
for the size, weight, and price it isn't worth it.

as stated by the many reviews , this is a discreet carpet cleaner
the la prima ran about half a shot then broke the machine.

and do not remove part one of the screen until part two is applied if you don't want big troubles
my kitchen appliances are horribly taken care of
anker, don't like it
too small
a gas cooktop would be way more worse and a smooth cooktop would probably not be much better .
anyway i do not recommend this one for its high price and low quality .
i purchased this to replace a knife that was broke.
this is the second one of these that i have had to purchase.
these tongs seem to have the locking mechanism backwards and don't work.
i have tried a lot of them and this was disappointing.
on the other hand for power grating it does not work.
i had two terrible problems, one caused the rating to num_num num_extend
everything seems to stick and it is something you need to worry about
didn't read any reviews
i used this set with a toaster oven and with a coleman camping oven and it caused a lot of difficulty.
