and i mean really be her friend.
sounds like a rhetorical question :)
men play at love to get sex, women play at sex to get love.
i don't want to be mean.
on average id say about 45% at first but than one you get to knowthe person maybe 15%
because some women send men tiny messages with out saying it clearly.
lets get coffee and chat and take it from there!
i also hate seeing my dad unhappy.
ask him to go see a doc.
post more questions on yahoo answers!
besides don't you think he has enough to worry about?
but i dont htink that by not having sex with him he will become unfaithful or leave you.
anyway my question is.... will i always feel that way?
but he might enjoy all the waiting, dreaming & teasing.
and i want to try again.
not all the time, sometimes men shave them, it depends on the woman,
well if u really like this guy smile and make nice talk with him.
i don't know about love,but he likes you for sure
i'd ask you out, but i live in oregon and have no idea where you live...
i can onli say...women r complicated...
i know i'm overtly picky about people how can i stop it!
it does sound a little girlie.
sometimes the difficulties are worth it if the the good outweighs the bad
that's if u both agreed on doing this.
one girl michelle, who probably wouldn't mind being named, spoke up and said she didn't believe in it.
well,if the one boy picks on you, why like him?
also sometimes guys think they dont need you so bad until your gone.
but if a guy asks u dont be afraid to say no.
do i want to be in love?
(that's what i called it).. but, why?
if you look creepy and you look..they'll all think you're leering.
confusing... yeah, i think your right.
how do i get my sweetheart to show me he loves me
if u really really really really really really like them
( even if he is rich, dont sell ur self.
u sound like a very lovely person so dont let some of these gals drag you down.
i dont know.but i know of another website that i go to..
no seriously, think about howmany cocky girls are out there.
without having a boyfriend would be a bit slutty.
then he said do you want some of my chapstick?
hold her hands, look to her eyes and say it, but only say it if you really love her.
you never let a man mistreat you
nope, he's too darned big and i'm too darned weak!
and if he says yes than you can tell him.
what was the mistake that you did
king had a song about this - only your mother loves you (and see might be jiving too).
we fall in love they treat us bad why are we there
and if you have, what was it like?
if she gets drunk then it is not a turn off.
only if you want it to be.
it's like breaking a drug habit.
oh man i should do that when im dating next time!
but you do what you want.
it sounds like you are both comfortable with things just the way they are.
don't let her rule your life, she will just have to learn to deal with it.
if he doesn't then there are too many fish in the sea.
no single man can give you what you really want.
that said u need to figure out youself if u want to stay married to him.
start with a basic everyday question and go from there :)
ask if they wanna go somewhere with you.
trust him, don't bring it up again.
:) i haven't tried it yet, but i am still trying to get up the nerve....
just find one that loves you too.
come to my town ill be your girl....
stay 100 miles away from this guy.
it's your choice not to hate one, i dislike them to say the least.
i would say around 3 or 4
i don't know....how would you like something crammed up your butt!!
he's telling that to some gurls too... he's a womanizer..
probably because i knew all the girlfriends were not really the one until i met my wife.
and whatever you do, don't try to have both of them at once.
sex is not the only thing important in life damn it!!!!!
i have yahoo email and that works for me.
fun includes eating meals (not breakfast if yo know what i mean).
but he was a lil busy after that.
and that will be just s*x!
please don't go up to her and tell her how good she looks.
sounds like u r going through a lot right now.
but ask a girl about the sympthoms because i'm a boy.
i always felt the same way, but i met my true love and my views changed!
guys are stupid!who knows why they do what they do.
but -- there's no better person to marry someday than your best friend!
i dont wanna just randomly go up nd be like go out wiht me?
you sorta stuck yourself out thier to get hurt, unless you know him fairly well.
u need to reput it in add it back just like first time
no good or bad is your personal belief on something.
they bother u all day long.
go to hawaii...ha ha ha or....pay someone...lol
his/her intelligence,the way they carry themselves,good looks and activeness
i can just toss him to side and forget about him like last night's trash........lol
like clear liquid and turns yellow when dry?
if she sits on your bestfriends lap because she is drunk then yes it is a turn off.
well if it was before you then he wasnt cheating at all... obviously.
!he must be a control freak
its one of the gifts we can always give ourselves.
and get married only after you've been with a guy for more than 2 years.
to all my fellow girls at cone, a big hi and hug!
just be yourself when you are with her.
what the hell r ya talking abt?
...a guy asks me,'do you mind if we cuddle?
but some guys would do that... why?
there are lost of good women left you just have to look in the right place.
either you move on with your life or you try to make it work with this person.
get a grip, how can you love someone that you don't even communicate with.
find a girl who has talets she also must be prety
it doesn't mean that you are slutty.
the one time in your life to really live out the true fantasy of love!
you have to search yourself for this one...
give them 2 months they will get over you.
after a while you dont even see the color.
he is probably wondering if your interested in him at all....flirt back!!
if she is not into you anymore...
you are definitely not a hoe, don't worry.
;) there is no way to make someone fall in love with you.
if you're asking, then you should break-up w/ and open yourself to other options.
have you ever had a pap smear.
yes all i can say.. but yes, i have long black hair and im proud!!
i had a friend in the same situation.
maybe your young, i don't know.
hi, my name is xxxxxx been working for me for years.
i don't understand someone please give me the answer
if you truely love him you will tell him
just go with your feelings if you like her so much then go with it.
ask yourself and decide.and if you can afford it, do if you want to.
stay alive and get your old life back.
dude, what your sayin is she doesn't want to be more than bf and gf?
don't use pick up lines, that's a turn off.
it hurts....alot...maybe some girls might say that's it?
tell him what you really want...that's what they tell me but never got to do...speak up...
(it would be easier to do if i were mad, though!!
if they have moved on then you should too.
no, you are punish, and no tv for a month
tell him, and it wouldn't seem psycho cuz u have kno each other for a long time
but thats her way... you could try it that way or you could just keep your eyes open...
it is very complcated tell it again please but in simple
give them a chance to discover you.
unless it's with the wrong man.
my bf loves me to death and doesnt want to give me up.
depends on if they are brunette or not
it's got to get played out after a while.
everybody likes to be told that they're hot, even if they don't admit it!
downtown houston just about any weekend... lots of clubs...
good luck but do your homework!
i'll go with anything natural than fake i even hate the word fake
if you like the guy then go for it.
only now she and i are both divorced.
who said women dont feel anything?
no matter what he says, action speaks louder then words
i was thinking about a medium pink color, but with what??
see if he calls, e-mails or even cares.
and never ignore her always listen to her...and when you do don't change the subjetct women hate that.
i am in college and he is my only sourse of income until i get out.
she will tell you if it's not ok.
i dont think i mind either way.
don't eat where you take a s***.
also try getting some blonde highlights
dont worry about him n just sonsentrate in school so you can lern n then woory bout yer b/f
b) looks definitely matter, anyone saying they don't is probably lying.
ohhh this is what i did - big bad mistake on my part.
you give at least 5 minutes for kissing and huging and may be some licking also.
what special gift can i give my would be brother in law for his birthday?
try to be your self and don't show off
good luck and i hope everything goes well!
if they dont then you'll have to get on with your life.
but ur first kiss should feel like ur in hevan.
i feel this is most beautiful in a family life.
lol most important... just be yourself.
i know 3 guys that i can probably get away with doing something like that.
they probobly know you cant really hide that but you should tell your parents
this is doc izzy and i love and adore bigger women!
if he if flurting with her ok jump him.
stick with the 13 & 14 year old boys.. they are easier to control anyway.. lol good luck
tell him that u jst wannabe friends and that u r relly disappointed that he would act so dumb!!!
i guess it's kind of nice, it's like your dad's blessing all the way.
wait for him to ask u out unless ur real desprete
i really like this guy, and i don't know if it's just a crush, or if i love him......
if he insists, it means he only after sex.
i find if i try real hard i can see things i know aren't there normally there.
i would like to have some fun with u that's why i answered this stupid question
do u fell that way?
give your brother some money and tell him to take a hike!!
maybe he's going to call you!
a good way is to imagine yourself without him/her.
make it your top priority to see her if you really want to be with her that bad
so i guess i pick domestic goddess.
do u love her in depth?
also men get bored and tire way before woman do.
a big savings area is flowers.
ill like to visit usa what are the needfull things
if you aren't happy fix it or get out.
just because he has the potential to be a great boyfriend doesnt mean he is.
then she might say that looks ugly i think (a color) looks better.
you can do a civilian arrest answ3r3r
u can have a big u-no-what, n suck in bed.
so so sexy yes it look very nice on most any girl
guys have a problem with secrets.
yes but it dipends of the guy
people asked me - whats the hurry?
they both dont respect your feeling.
ok i see him ever week in psr but i just cant talk to him!!!
i dont like a guy dat does dat all da time.
i think it's totally hot when a guy shaves his legs.
did turn gay or is it a curiosity thing?
i myself think that they do.
it is a mistake that can't be undone!
in a park when i was 16 i lost my virgenate
they never met but she says they're in love.
and ask if he wants to dance with you.
and people life is to short live it to the fulliest and have faith
did you fell goog because i want to have sex, but you have to be careful
like i said; he already knows that you like him, so just take a deep breathe and ask him.
keep away ur fear and tell him.
and im sure as heck not driving 5 hrs just to hang out unless i really really like her.
does she have other friends to gab with on the fone?
play sports with your guy friends.
when you first fall in love, your gitty, goofy, and silly happy just thinking about that person.
i can't see my life without my husband.
we always seem to push the ones taht we love away.
wait til you get older and if you both still feel the same way then go for it!
tell her, girls like to her the truth good luck
do you really want to spend the rest of your life with someone you argue with all the time.
you are a man <--- term used lightly!!
i prefer a & b cups, myself.
any women beside the ugly guys will look hot...
no 10 years younger, who wants an older women?
it happened to me and i am now dating that person
just let her know what you feel.
show her your naked baby pictures.
why do gays want to get married?
on the hood of my car at a waterfront in a light rain it was awesome!
and women also expect guys to act like that, so why should they grow up?
but you need to do this a few times.
whle making love is like living a fantasy.
as for now i think he is mad, hurt, upset and got over you.
if anyone know let me know
red= love, black = death ect...
i like thick because i feel cheated with a thin one!
if you don't know ask someone who would.
then comes the fun part...he making it up to you :-)
wow, go with the one that picks on you because 9 times out out 10 he likes you
ok i have liked this on girl since i was in ninth grade.
you catch her looking at you?
i never knew life could be so good!!!!
ok like i really really really like this guy and i dont know if he likes me back.
do whats best for you and he
hey it's better than her givin u a fake # to call lol!
so in my opinon ur not a hoe!
but if they cannot exercise self-control, let them marry.
she calls him all the time.
you are already doing it so why yet bother?
there are many times that you love the guy but not sure did he love you also.
should i dump him because of his mother
make a kind move, if no responce u know what to do!
i've heard of friends getting married about 6 months after meeting somebody.
be yourself say whats up and you might get a response
show her what you're good at.
you will look like an idiot.
finally a culture that has it right.
if you don't you'll always wonder.
let me know what you think, thanks
i wouldn't worry too much about it.
what's the worst that could happen.
i'm confused i hate the girl to be like that... what shall i do?
preferrably someone who doesn't hate you.
stop trying to slap it in everyones face!!!
that's not exactly true.... it's just that most girls are discreet about it...
some guys just don't like to dance.
this generation is just too stupid.
so you have one baby out of wedlock.
it depends on if you could trust him before!
ugly (or fat) guys just take what they can get.
people are husbands and wives for reasons!!!
if all you do is argue it's not worth it..
have fun in jail asking that question to your cell mate.
u are asking do u like me
depending on what you kissed;)
)women are curious about sex with other women, even me!
20 to 32...she doesn't have to be younger than you.
simple...honesty and love and try to true with them
then u can make an easier decision.
pickup lines are tacky..just be yourself and complament her alot..women like that
but he chaeted, so i guess i can lift or carry my husband.
just try and make the best of what's to come.
depending on what yo uare looking for, freindship only, like.
i think he would make a great valentine.
(this is really hard because there are a lot of temptations out there).
is it usually about a year before both people begin 2 feel in that comfortable,boring, stage??
it all depends on when ur ready.
hell ya i would love to meet the ladys!!
dont try to figure it out thats jus the way it is.
remember being friends with someone online is ok but there are limits.
if u can imagine him as the father of ur children!
if he turns you down, hes not worth it in the first place!!!!
well to tell u tha truth u learn but u have to actually do it.
you married your hubby hopefully because you love him.
well depend on women wot she want
i know i have someone to come home to.
get a massage..and get away from it all..hehe..
i have no idea where to begin!!!
that depends...are you a hottie w/a body?
r u talking about ur avatar?
hang out all day together and to top it off touch his feet.
if a guy cares he calls.
if u you act like dat all da time she might think u desperate.
however, i always believed in the fact there's a huge different between having sex and making love.
first off, i have 4 kids....so a homemaker is more work than my job even.
don't just stay with him for the baby.
are you a country girl or a city girl.
getting married and getting child can wait but studies can't.
i have never been to it
the same guy you wanna be in a relationship with?
how often can you have sex with pam anderson?
make sure you dont make her hate you just get your point across too her
my mom also has cancer and this just hits to close to home for me.
i love curly hair i like to run my fingers thru it
i mean the both of you together.
u just have to be patient and the right girl will come along.
i want my wife to grow too.
you should probaly make a move because he is obviosly shy
the doctor can't even believe it.
if you play w/both at the same time, she will probably f-*# the sh%$ out of you!
practice kissing me were do you live?
may be u think not but yes!!!
may be becaues your name is freakgirl but if you show your face maybe not no hard feelings
no men don't but little boys do
how about...would you like to go out with me sometime?
hell, it happened to me twice.
you shouldn't go out with a guy because you'need' to.
if you really wanted to be with him, you wouldn't be asking.
and i hope to god it doesn't ever pass!
honestly, most girls are just waiting for the guy to tell her how he truly feels.
plus they are more passionate in love makin.
never stop trying to impress her.
leaning in and giving me a soft kiss just on the forehead.
yes im not one of those people but i know there are lots of them
its all about her, and no it shouldnt be something that happends on a first date.
ok it depends on how much your starting to have feelings for this boy!
thanks for the pep in advance!
why do they want to be married???
we like soft approch and a lil bit of chasing.
i married my guy anyways and do you know why (besides love).
-a trip to amusement park such as roller coaster or even theatrical museum.
i like sos and need to know if im in love
do you like fake nails or manicured ones?
only two points to make friends 1.
but now we do all these things together and i dont know what to do..
i don't know what u mean.
i asked him if he still liked me and he said yes but he didn't act like it.
well, you, and that sexy perfume you wear!!
practice to unrap starburst wrappers with your tounge, the girls love it!
it really depends on the guy but i think most guys seriously don't care.
i can't explain it...and no, it has nothing to do with them looking young, vulnerable or submissive.
as everyone said... dont get married so early.
if you plan on cheating on your wife...you're a freaking pig and need to be shot!
then be your best self, if he's impressed or likes you he'll talk back
you dont want anyone else but that person ever
don't persue it, he is getting married.
have you told her that it's kind of irritating with her having to check up on you everyday?
so, when i moved in my neighbor asked me out.
most teen boyz prefer girls that like sex.
he dribbles... he shoots... he scores... 2 points...
if not, then don't sweat it!
do you like to argue and fight???
if he really didn't like her and did like you, then he would have already dumped her for you.
the main thing is to not try to get back at the one who wronged you.
one man willing to move 21 hours/1,400 miles just to be with me.
just want to know have you been to the doc yet!
maybe she's not a beeeatch and the skinny chick was
get a life and don't waste mine.
its like if you decide to eat chocalate and then moan cuz u look too fat.
i went and there he was.
if he is, then go for it!
men like this, typically become wife beaters if you don't obey them!
you like him or you don't like him?
but if u are sure then first tell your parents if you havent done allready.
many people will tell you no!
if u think that he feels the same way about you, why not?
so there are some guys that only say the l word if they mean it.
it defenetely looks like he has feelings for u.do u show how u feel;;u should!!
well i believe everybody should keep their own name.
guys come & go, but friends are forever!
imgaine if it was just considered love??
if your relationship survive the four seasons... i guess you should be ready....
ok now some guy's like girls like that and some don't
if you want kids, then homemaker.
should i or shouldn't i. younger guy vs older woman
of course he wants to go on.
stay true to your husband...after all, he's the one you said i do to...
so it would have to be love.
ur self image is also very important.
im a gilr, i say those things....
girls are just as perverted--trust me.
:) although, flowers are really nice even if they don't last.
there are movies that i haven't seen yet.
it is realy sweet and just what u r looking for!
my be she don't love you but try to use your brean not your haerd
no offense, but it kinda sounds like a girls name ya know but no disrespect intended!
i wouldn't bother calling him back.
none come in my list so i choose my neighbors wife :d
marriage is really about trusting & communicating
don't listen to what anyone else tells you to do.
what shuld i do to get her?
give a rose and express ur love
its unusal yes, but nothing bad.
you have to find whats right for you and your partner/s!
coz they are girls man and they are not as sofisticated as we are!
yes for sure, especially when she throw up!!
because....you know.......try to search you love.....but becareful.....!!!!!!
i can't help any more unless i have more infor.
there isn't a wrong or right way to kiss anyone.
do you have to rush your choice?
having fun with guy friends is ok. 1.
just think about what you like and do it back for them....kinda like a tounge massage.
my boyfriend was definitely my friend first and it is total bliss!
it's more of a trust issue i'd say.
i just need someone to help me figer this out
then if he still doesn't like you, then move on.
he probably doesnt want to either.
when possible, try to make it yourself.
yeah ok men work and fix things but what else can you do?
i told her that i loved her and truly meant it.
all seniors think freshman girls are easy, its sad but true
so how do i just kiss him
go to deleted items and it should be there
i hope you find a nice girl.
i don't think it's good idea, u are not there for this purpose!
the list could go on and on.
brokeback mountain,ok it's a guy but at least you'll be happy!
i think as long as you dont base your relationship on sex its ok
i prob will tell her soon cuz shes my best friend ha well any help would be nice.
yes, and it is bad luck to see the bride at the wedding.
good luck and hang in there.
umm small party for the family
and if you are worried about doing it - performance wise - dont.
i would be, but i'm just married!
i think it all depends on age, upbringing,.
you both should pick either his or yours once you have kids.
your kid is going to have hard enough time growing up without a dad.
men without hair look like little boys to me, and it's not sexy at all.
give it a chance because if you break up with them it would be harder to be friends
or ask about the score of last game?
get rid of the x if you are dating the guy you love right now.
the best way and easiest way is to fly or drive to las vegas and get married there.
sure let me know more'bout you
anything bigger than a handful is a waste, probably a size c or d
lie lie lie and then lie some more
they have never proformed before and it doubles the plesure!
wife says, we don't wear that shit.
we dont no what you look like!
bcozz we always find a life partner therfor we attract with opposite side
lol i think this is better than the one on top of me...
don't go anywhere you went with him or her.
talk 2 your best friend and see if its cool
sounds strange but it worked in about 3-5 days for me!
when he teases you about the stupid little things.
no, because i'm not married yet
lots of men like thick girls, most of them are black.
i love to express my feelings to the ladies with poems, has anybody written one for a special someone.
i have told her i liked her and she said she would want to ruin or friendship.
no and u shouldnt care.if u like him then stay with him.
or does his friends point at you when your with him.
i love them b/c im a guy and i dont have to ask anyone to the dance
if you feel this strongly about it then maybe you shouldn't get married.
it really depends if someone is vain or not.
move on and find someone who doesn't hate you.
you should get to know her and sooner or later you will ask her out or she will.
so ofcourse i had to ask him if he was blowin me off.
maybe some perverted guys like the really young looking asian girls
whatever you decide, make it completly yours!
tell him you don't want a real relationship.
if you are happy she should be happy, unless he really is being bad to you.
there is nothing but trouble there!
not always the easiest but they have been pretty good years.
and hes seen me every day for about 4 or 5 years!
imagine that i am that guy and be my girl freind!
it never hurts to be flirty!
but stick with wats inside of u.
best of luck to you both :)
i've been with this girl for 8 months and we haven't kissed is this bad?
depends on the woman, it's better shaved=-)
i think they just look better than a whole lot of nations out there.
even the day after would be okay.
then see if shes open for a dinner & a movie.
yes some men get right down to it with absolutly no thought for the woman.
ask in english terms...cannot understand you
sorry, i never have felt that way!
remember, no bird ever flew on one wing!!
i actually ponder this one now and again.
u seem desperate and you'll never find a if you're desperate.
imet a girl and i want to know how to know if shes into me or not
but don't just sit around waiting for the phone to ring.
shut the hell up and be gay if you want to!!!
many women 22 are dating men 27 so the 22 yo men feel insecure and have to fish downstream
if he comes to his senses then great if not screw him!!
i mean if u love him and he really loves u he may want to disapoint his father.
(saying sorry to him without commiting a mistake is humilation to ur self...and don't ever get weak!!)
do it before it is to late
this gal does not want a bad boy at all.
i`d like to see what a black female has to say about this.
help me win this debate with her!
most often (not always) that will be guys around your age, give ot take.
when will people in this effed up world finally realize this?!?!?!?!?!?!
and i dont know what i should do.
you go to a bar and get drunk!
i did this with my current boyfriend.
no, not if you have to ask...
rather than just sit there and wait till u are a good one.
(and now even in devorce im stuck with it!
you'll be fine just have fun!
your girlfriend will just think you're a jerk.
her parents?u can't fix it... her friends?maybe u can talk to them nicely...but, pls specify, why?
now me, i wouldn't marry any women who didn't want to change her name, but that is just me.
maybe you should try dating girls if guys offend you so.
my ex of 3 years cheated.
time wiil tell give it six months and see what happens.
well, the one i liked goes like this.
not all guys get bored and move on.
they're a lot of fun - there's plenty to do.
but it is okay to kiss on the first date.
i have a close girl friend.
they are always in the'in love' stage.
when he does explain to him that it was a mistake to break up and want him back.
my friend says i am to nice and i should tell them no.
but (there's always a but isn't there?
not all guys, but some guys do
that way you can still go by your last name!
go up to her and say'hi, are you single?'
that got me really hot, but i ran off.
however that does not mean that big girls can't be cute.
not everyone on here is in school.
practice unwrapping starburst with ur tongue, and tieing cherry stems w/ your tongue.
if you keep talking to him for another week,he might think he is married to you.
me, i'll pick up the tab if, i can get your vote for best answer.
you should probably be looking in a public place where you are most comfortable.
flirt and see how he reponds
plus it takes the pressure off of me to ask someone...
say will u go out with me!!!!!!!!
(i mess up alot at times ) but she don't forget.
is how should i approach her and be not just another guy hitting on her?
as a guy - let me say this.
you're 13 don't even worry about it...
always trail ride with a friend.
if you guys truely love each other then u can work out all the fighting etc.
its all in the eye contact
yup, i can lift him, he's only 185....lol
he just has to start over and earn your trust again.
listen it aint that easy.i got with my ex-boyfriend in 2nd grade,then again in 4th,and again in 8th.
sak her out what's up with that?
well i hope you read this really well.
play a truth or dare game together
wait until you find that out for sure first and then go from there!
stupid u need a theory class 4 that!!!!!!!
if you do eat something like that then just quit.
now i keep thinking of getting it on with a girl.
confront him and ask him that way you will know
yes jaime is going to ask rubi out.... but it is not yoru business...
because neither of you have the guts to call it quits
may be its interesting for them
he dribbles... he shoots... he scores... 2 points...
or do guys really do prefer bigger women?
he loves you, too, girl...time will tell.
if a guy really respects u then he'll understand.
this is sin, our selves have started this
his answer is good enough for me...
move on, but you can still luv him!!
intellect - a chick with brains is just sexy!
i like older girls so i think this is sick and wrong that they cant go out with her
when my sis kisses someone she closes her eyes to get ready.
my last bf i met driving round a roundabout in another car!!
but he is getting married this month.
should i just forget it and move on?
replaying everything you ever did to me?
okay well first thing it sounds as if you guys are already married!.
first of all, why did u guys break up?
maybe if you give him space he will eventually call you back.
tell more ppl (my bor did)
so just take it day by day-step by step.think of how he lost a good thing.
say hey(whateverhisnameis) when ya taking me to dinner???
no, not if you have to ask.
go to school you can still come home or call your family and friends.
i never wanted to have sex again.
let him make the first move if u do it may make u look like ur ubsesd with him!
some people choose not to because of thier religion, others don't.
you should be proud of yourself.
so, no i feel its a choice and one does what feels comfortable to them.
you gotta think about that and that should help you out on seeing if you can trust him!
i don't mean, do you think women are sexy and beautiful.
just tell them, what are they gonna do, slap you??
sound like you like to sell yourself to much.
see if he is willing to go out the way for you.
but it doesn't mean you cannot love another.
how would anyone know if they don't know anything about you?
who gives a crap what anyone else thinks.
if you could have 4 qualities in your woman, what would they be.
we like it when guys do things for us and think about us.
i feel goofy, dorky, and happy.
just keep it cool, a little hard to get might help!
look at the way she walks.
if you two are at a dance, he shouldn't really care.
gals luv guys with positive self image.
ask her out after class again.
you should go see a shrink!
i think im still totally in love w/ him...
but thats ok. im a giver.wink, wink.
want to get something you can not get rid of go ahead then
you just have met the dumb ones out there that think skinny is better.
but i am not telling you to be celibate till then;-)
if he doesn't want to dance, then give it up.
hey, i'm a guy, but i'll tell you a little.
my girlfriend always says she loves me when were passing notes during class, butshe doesnt say it confrontationally
we can't answer if she really means it.
hey i really want to know so please help me out!!
i have long black hair and i love it,hubby loves it too.
everything seems so open and hit and run with most people these days.
wanting to be something they're not?
no you wont huni......i was married to a complete arsehole!!!!
stay away from this guy friend.
i'm just looking for the girl who wants that time with me
and its been the best thing for at least me.
i met this guy once, very romantic, i met him in this huge rainstorm.
i mean of course you will be making more money if you work hard.
could it ever be the same...
it could be (choose one & why?)
so wait for another 4 years.
either way, best of luck but i'm just glad that i have brown hair!!
if your talkin hubby or the like i'd say tools toys for his vehicle, sports related things.
not what you can become just because she says too.
the problem is that he cheated on me recently and it was the worst that he could of done.
well, if u can imagine ur self with him in bed @ night!!
it hurt like hell and i bled.
it could probably mean a lot of things.
10 years gap is just nice.
stick yourself out there more, you have to do far more than eye contact
you want all your friends forever?)
and i hate him for it.
but, i know exactly what i want in a relationship.
in the middle of the river while there was ppl watching it was actually pretty fuuny!!
if yor hott too show him your boobies
so its natural with that guy.
i see a malaysia air ad on tv and i go gaga.
go out & do everything you couldn't when you were with him/her!
yes it is very possible to enjoy giving pleasure rather then recieving it
its been half a year- is it normal 2 still like him??
if you start to feel the it comming on then start the four play again.
guys will think youre hot no matter what with this usually.
it is absolutely just a challenge!!!!!!!!!!!
everywhere.... just ask any girl passing by.... but only in thailand.... not in us.... lol
is very important to last at least 30-45 minutes!!!
problem is i really like him.
cause it's buy one take one.
wow i didn't think pakistan is that conservative.
we can restle around and be the best of friends.
i hardly everrr see him in school either usually i see hima't my brothers basketball games.
you didn't give us very good information/ do you all live in one house.
..... you tell her why you like her!
its one way of saying i don't like you!
hey, its like, everyone's gotta seperate some day or the other.
i even worked there for awhile and met the man of my dreams.
i'll probably go and see one.
why wait,,,,, go ahead do it
girl there are more guys out there that love thick girls than u think?
it really was a casual aside when i said it -- i didn't think he would remember.
girls don't like guys who is all about themselves.
yes there are you just have to look.
depending on the age, cds or dvds.
both of u work hard to get it right!!
if she's interested she'll call later.
i really care about you and i can't stop thinking about you.
overtime should i give him another chance?
if you feel your love is fading, don't just sit there and do nothing!
don't know, but daniel k has never read manga.
try using some of these, but only if they actually apply!!!
and i hear ya fountain...same thing happened to me.
or that she just wants to see other people?
pick the one you like the most.
just be prepared to let her go.
i have a problem of unloading all my junk up front and maybe i told this guy to much.
i guess its normal, but id just move on
just get rid of him you will be better off
sometimes but you have to observe the one you call your man.
or if he gets them first, you get the popcorn.
and so what if it is a rebound relationship for both of you?
my girlfriend's the nuttiest, but i love her anyway.
u'll find a man who really deserves u one day).
be strong, and hang in there.
or, what about blue and green?
some guys do...and some guys don't.
generally kind and my fifth: i'll just be dissapointed if she's stupid.
it's not that bad... at least it is not bella
i hoping for at least a 90% but realistically i think its more like 70% or 65%.
think about what good it brought about.
i do not know what she wants.
my bff hates my b/f and wishes for me to break up w/ him but i won't.
we was hangin out a lil.
you still released at least a thousand!
all my friends want to do is makeout!
happy birth day to you.
because women think with their brains.
complement her...ask her name...dont act weird...act like u r the smoothest guy ever.
after how much time can you conclude that it takes too long and she isn't really interested?
girls don't think it's cool, they think it's guys who smoke are pathetic cos they are killing themselves
so i'm only myself around guys i dont like, and you know the outcome.
the timing just wasnt right for it with the old guy...you'll see!
take them both out at the same time
i am the maid of honor for my only sister and i want it to be perfect!
my boyfriend snores and i have the most terrible time sleeping!
why does it matter what they think if they dont get along dont spend time togather.
if you want your girlfriend forever..........then just don't let her know that you want her forever, simple.
if she is calling just to bablle then tell her to not call you so often!
i have to stop right away because i'm ready to relieve myself.
for me anything after 3 days and i might start to forget about you.
or just you wanna say that!?
i agree with the other preson before anyone gets hurt
people don't like to be played yo-yo with.
who knows but i would absouletly love that 2 be done 2 me.
and impress her with affection and love.
man has penis and woman has clitoris.
by now, you might love your wife for everything you guys have endured.
i don't need a trophy girl i want a companion.
i hate it my self, i love the straight ones
if shae like him then there is a reson.
there no one you can trust more than a good friend!
thats weird but maybe idk ill talk to my friend by his locker.
if your the average guy breast size shouldn't matter.
i am man and i too feel so.... because i too am!!!
try to contact their q&a team..they'll help you through..have a nice day!
i like intelligent,fun and hot girls.
hell yeah for the first answer.that girl answered for me.
if he/she want to see you picture rightaway it sex!
uh- wher've u been meeting these filipinas?
maybe ask him out to lunch or a movie or somthing.
no i haven't..i prefer normal-looking guys
i had someone get nasty with me because i was still dating?
i'm ready to move on, but i love him way too much!
yea ask for permission by all means and watch how fast she slap the s--- out you
guys think that they are special, and that they are only good enough for certain girls.
depends, some days i want to have sex, somedays i don't.
this is just what i have nurt many times.
it just sounds like u wear the pants.
hang in there for one that apprecaites you.
don't come here, it smells like a trap to me.
smaller of course, and it is all about looks!!
sweetheart let him go,if he is ment to be with u he will come back to you
the guy i like is mad at me.
so - u like asian food?
my cuzin met up with some wierd old perv saying he was a hot teen that she met online
if you have to ask, then you are not in love.
dont even listen to what people not just guys say, watch how they act.
its ur personalitie, keep to it, whether a guy goes out with u shouldnt determin how u act.
i still love him what to do
just talk your spouse about this
if you flirt with him, the challange is not there.
or you could tell her and have one of those fairy tale romances...
you are killing the romance by popping up that stupid question, ever thought of having fun together instead?
also actual kissing and asking if your a good kisser...
haha julesac is funny, but mean.
see my boyfriend (go to my 360)?
the fact that a guy is sooo self centered is a huge turn off for me.
i know because i am just like your wife.
if u have to ask other people i really dont think ur ready to
rip off your shirt and do a tarzan yell.
unless you dont love your husband anymore and you have room for another man????
compliments, honesty and make it about her.
i'm into a 6th grade boy too!
beacuse they feel insecure with less educated guys..........
maybe you and i can get together sometime & we'll find love with one another.
if she will tell the administration i will be expelled coz its pakistan not america
my friend has a bf who she talks 2 online and on the phone.
but cuddling up with a large women is one of the best feelings i know of.
i think the bomb is much easier!!
one his side of his family i met his father.
anything that is not nailed down!
be her friend first then see where it goes
i was cheated on for 3 of the years.
jump him because she likes him??
dont tell them but let them find out once your in bed with her.
here in america it is not so important...
be confident,always believe in yourself.do not be arrogant though.always make good eye contact.listen to what she has to say.
let it take it's course from there.
i dated one and i know.
i wish i had listened to my friends
if he doesn't start acting right, then leave him.
just do what makes you happy!
we tried to move on but it didn't work.
if you dont ask sombody else might.
my twin wont talk or listen to me
most girls are polite she'll answer it
you married him and it was for a reason.
just face him, say hey i like you wanna see a movie?
some woman cannot seem to find guys their own age attractive.
but that didnt bother me, because like i said wa&#92;e were just friends.
in that case tkake some defense classes.
at least thats what it seems like to me.
how drunk is this girl getting?
u should take the time to get to know both of them equally without goin out with them.
do you know he loves you?
you can join a community site with live chat and webcam chat
those was good times i tells ya.
if your a hoe then he's one to...i personally don't think your one tho
because the white women are taking up all the men!!
ofcourse, if she calls like 5 times a day about that, then it would be crazy.
either that or you are the only one he has a chance at getting some booty from
tell the bastard to get out.
good god how old are you?
they think that they can control other peoples lives when thye cant
if you really love him, you would let him go...
someone i can be myself with.
the rest is easy from there!!
say i love you and if the wait to say it back it tells it all
i just got out of a 3 yr relationship with my baby's father.
good luck in your search for the one!
after i while i't passes and i still love him
look, he already knows that you like him, and has he said anything bad about it?
some women like big hairy guys, some guys like fat women, some gals like skinny guys, and vice-versa.
my wife forgives me for alot of things.
what if you tell him that you just want to be friends with benefits.
i like him and he says stuff like, if i weren't dating _ i would go out with you?
they are often worse than men!!!
is she just trying to use you?
dont do things tht can get you hurt.
you would be genuinly suprised in the type of people that go to them.
wait till you get 25. you would not loose your charm by then.
so if you're set on that, that's the way to go!!
so thats why i ask why dont guyz ever know what they want with any kinda relationship!?!?!
if you need your x emotionally - then ya got some troubles.
but really if you're used to it and you kinda like it, go with it.
remember, till death do you part!!
wit her takin ur number, there's nothing wrong wit that.
if yes, why do i heard some girl said flowers ar not going to last?
and don't start with her looks, mister!
if you two are serious then asking her that question shouldn't bother her.
the pictures i've seen...i would say maui or the bahamas.
the problem is not if u ask her while at work or not.
it was really nice how he asked me out.
what a typical double standard you have set up!!
i cant give you a wife view but hopefully mine is just as good.
yes be disappointed and be mad!!
there was his stop so he got off the train.
20 years down the road that is all you can be so start from the beginning
don't be afraid to say no.
leave it alone-i don't care what she says, she's in enough pain.
for one thing if it doesn't work out there goes your job.
going to a club and dancing.
man how many times i passed up a great oppertunity by worrying about someone saying no......
how do i get he to stop nagging me and leave me alone.
when you 18 or 20 because when they said something they dont mean it
i would wonder why he shaved them but, in the end, they're his legs!
be really nice and give eye contact and smile a lot.. hope this helps!
i am just curious to what everyone thinks.
for the guys: (a) do you prefer a bigger woman or a smaller woman?
she definitely wants you to think she's good looking, but she doesn't want that to be reason #1.
only that i can say: good luck!
i only once told a girl that i loved her, and i meant it.
then go pick them up (if she say yes).
chances r, if u like her as a friend, ull like her as more.
keeping secrets only hurt the ones you love.
be you show a little toghness thats what girls like atleast most of them but mostly be yourself
don't worry what people will say.
and any guy who sas he woul is prolly not being entirely honest with himself.
let him go... either that or date his brother!
death is like a box full of candy corn
some do, but i would rather have a pair that were not too big
others like think due to society dictates its; i say screw society and give me thick!
that only makes her easier to bed.
if you like him that much,call him.
b/c you dont have any decision power what to do
it's your own life, as you said.
keep getting her younger and younger guys as one gets old get a new one for her...
ps im not a stay at home romantic dinner type of girl.
am doing this just for the points lol
thats a chance your gonna have to take.
work at it but don't let him keep you locked up at home.
whatever you do...do not tell him too soon!!!
i dont think it is wise to date at work.
if going to a movie is special for the 2 of you, then do that.
it comes right after threeplay and before fiveplay.
a sex toy, that way you can both enjoy it.
its a man thing live with it ego
i totally agree with udaman...good luck girl
i like him alot and i want to win him over not push him away.
only i am not thinking about him but i am having dreams about him.
least not till he gets another girlfriend.
play the field a bit now.
i always say that you shouldn't do things if your gonna regret them later.
the safest rules of internet dating are these: 1. chat via email and messenger 2. chat on the phone.
yes i have done it it was a lot of fun.
there are tons of cheap ideas out there, just find what you like and work with it!
so you might just be over looking the type of men who think the world of you..
keep seaching for a believer in romance, she's out there!
when you can fart in front of the one your dating
i hope i see some of it soon.
well just go up to her.
well i dont no how old you are which would help.
yes it is a sick habit
we have no room for screwed up animals like this in our society.
do you mean seem more sexy?
is this a trick question?
it's like saying, what's got to stop me when i have already done it?
the right date can save money on lots of things.
thats all i have 2 say.
why can't men (or boys in your case) ever say the word love?
and the gf should accept that about if she loves you.
he then asked me, can i come with you?
a lot of guys like that - just looking for sex.
a spasm in your back usually
i dont think so, maybe they should try taking our last names
becuz if you do then your gonna lose your friend over a guy!!!!
if he likes you, you'll know!
they like the challange i know thats what i love about it
if she likes music, make a special cd or tape.
but i need to be happy.
do not try to have sex.
when i fall in love, i feel stupid.
is worth the wait when you are ready.
you are too good for them
'...does this mean he likes me?.
but you know what, i feel the guy should make the first move.
if i would've kept my last name its just a freakin name.
seperate the bad thing and move on!
>>other than those two things, just ask him once in a while.
look, try and get out to meet people.
i'm still in love with my ex and i'm so mad at my cousin because my ex likes her.
so it was a good ideea!
celebrate valentine with joy and fun...give eachother gifts and hav a fun...
not for anything but lookin at
oh yes, the trick ass hoe's never had a chance.
but i think they both like me.
cuz they like the little titis and pussys
dont forget to choose and vote for best answer!!!
i've been with my husband for 4 years we recently got married in december of 2005.
nay pier is a great place or one of the museums....there r alot of great resteraunts of hotels.
well, in my experience, a lot of the time one of them ends up cheating on the other.
don't worry, i aint working with much either.
my mom books them all of the time pat@alanatvl.com
it's been over 6 months & i can't seem to get over it.
tell her to move to mass.............
to me it realy dose'nt matter, but a hand full is quite enought for me.
some girls prefer gifts that won't die on them...something that lasts.
she's strong and loving and most of all...really wasn't as happy as she thought she was.
if you are into sixth graders you are obviously young.
size, shape,looks, ect should not matter at all...
about what they think about gay marrige/ relationshiops?
i agree, just kiss him... he'll respond one way or another.
he handed me his cellphone and had me put in my phone number.
if you want to enjoy a bit - why don't you check out some restaurants, night clubs, gyms etc
so id say, they do work out, just not a lot of the times...hope this helps...
yah look me up if you are ever in florida lol!!!
be cool and ask her on a date!
hey im sorry i don't know and i wish best of luck to both of you!
hello: i am looking to visit your country.
look for another hot girl, so she will be jealous.
child please, dont ask that question if you dont want your feelings hurt
i do not know what to do because she knows how much i care about him.
and last but not least--- does he always just happen to be staring...?
slow down the pace maybe, fourplay,
depends on the girl i guess... fair skinned females look extra pale when they have black hair.
i was not gonna let her win.
never tell her she's fat big one!!!
what happened when the politician took viagra?
you know that's if u didn't play the guilt trip.
it sounds like he is having too much fun while you are away.
ummm yes i do i think anyone does!!
because some couples never get to that comfortable boring stage.
obviously, men ain't much better;-)
i never went out with him a second time.
maybe because your the most beautiful girl they have seen.
u need to be wit that person, you have found your true love
if the guy is worthy enough, u wont need to
your too young to be talking about kissing already.
first you order one online and the stork brings one to you
just on a much harsher scale as time goes on.
just move on with your life and frind some one eles!
depends on how old they are.
well all ur missing is a million dollar smile..:)
well basically you have to stop talking to him and stop thinking about him
the girls that whine that flowers don't last are just ungrateful.
haha thats why i am single!
the girlz that are pretty or have a great personality.
altho, i dont really like girls all that much.
cut your cousin an your ex boyfriend off complete.
i dont ever remember giving a girl a cristmas gift unless i liked her.
whos to say that country girls feel more sexy?
well i met mine in a carnival.
honey my husband likes me for me.
nope, she is not a liar.
if they don't, it's time to move on.
figure out what style of arrangements you would like and flowers.
as long as he dosent mind, who elses opinion matters?
you're probably just too good for him anyway.
and she still lets me play with my trucks and watch cartoons!!!!!
lime green would be more for a summer wedding.
i don't know can i do anything about it?
that's right, the right relationship happened on it's own.
looks don't really matter unless you are trying to prove something.
please be honest with me i can handle the truth
start the day off with breakfast out...then perhaps a nice walk.
i did this before (accidentally) and my friend was mad that i deleted him!
yes, girl down there, don't have sex.
ok, tell her, but be as polite as possible.
no.u guys kiss when ur ready
ask her questions (don't just talk).
i think you are probaly a nice guy and she probaly loves you alot.
when she calls, text her back
no!no!no!it certainly is most uncool.u r simply wasting ur health cos girls just hate it.
find someone u like and say will u be my valentine!
tell her that you miss her and that you love her.
if nothing work... u have to ask him for it again :-)
some do,some don't have it in them.
he wont turn you down.
no brainer oh and nice picture of george clooney on your profile lmao
he wants me to change how i look.
ok, those other replies are just cocky, i'm way more fine.
bad teeth, bad breath and bad bo.
there are not any words that are going to make it any better.
dang it, if only every man knew what women want the world would be a much happier place!!!
and you want to suck another man's d**k???
you people have no right to get married!
yeah, im a guy so i dont really have to pay.
you know.......if he wants to wear my pants all he has to do is ask.......sheesh!
what if it is a rebound relationship for both of you?
good luck in your search for your perfect match.
why does everyone seem to want someone that they cannot have and know that they should not want?
do you like to argue and fight?
if you are set on that, that is the way to go.
i went out with my ex for three years and then he/she cheated.
work at it and do not let him keep you locked up at home.
other than two questions, ask him just once in awhile.
also, men get bored and tired a long time before women do.
she is strong, loving, and wasn't as happy as she thought she was.
it is another way to say that they don't like you.
king has a song about this, it is called "only your mother loves you."
he loves you as well, but only time can tell what will happen.
he wants me to change my appearance.
i relish the fact that i have someone to come home to.
sex can feel great; but, you have to be careful.
do you want all your friends to be with you forever?
it does not mean that you are a loose woman.
you could try dancing at a club.
do not go any place you went with him or her.
there is plenty to do and they are a lot of fun.
it all depends on when you are ready.
stay 100 miles away for this man.
you have to be prepared that if it happened one time, it can happen again.
i am looking for the girl who want to spend time with me.
at least not until he gets another woman friend.
the wife says, "we do not wear that."
if you are asking, then you should break up with him/her and then open yourself up to other options.
why do homosexuals want to get married?
do not apologize if you have not made a mistake.
do you have to rush the choice?
both of them do not respect your feelings.
no seriously, think about how many arrogant women are out there.
she is too shy to ask him out.
get a brain, how can you love someone that you do not even communicate with.
i would ask you out, but i live in oregon and have no idea where you live.
they have never performed before, and it doubles the pleasure.
i will probably go and see one of them.
in any case, i wish you best of luck although i am glad that i have brown hair.
send me an e-mail at honorarius@yahoo.com, and i will let you know.
it is absolutely a great challenge.
i am a girl so i am will to help you out.
do not inform them but allow them to discover it once you are in bed with her.
if i would have kept my last name. it is merely a name.
i rarely see him in school either, i typically see him at my brother's basketball games.
he is stating that to some women as well. he is a lothario.
leave him, there are plenty of men out there.
i know this because i have a similar personality to your wife.
when she calls, text her back instead.
no, i am 5ft 4inches and he is 6ft and 2inches.
don't you know the cardinal rule is to never trust anyone?
we have tried to break-up a couple of times, but it does not happen.
also some who are thin and skinny because these days anorexic girls are attractive.
you would use your erect penis to penetrate her vagina.
in that case, you should take some defense classes.
i just ended a three-year relationship with the father of my baby.
what happened when the politician ingested viagra?
hello, my name is xxxx has been working for me for years.
i can only state that women are complicated.
we enjoy a gentle approach and a tiny bit of chasing.
you would actually be surprised at the kind of people that go to them.
it is invigorating, especially when you meet each other again after texting for several months.
i am in new york currently, i'd love to show you around if you'd like.
it sounds strange, but it worked in 3-5 days.
don't worry, i don't have that many option myself.
why does it matter what the think, if they don't even take the effort to get along or spend time together?
you have a good man, if he is.
you will know if he is attracted to you!
i suppose it is normal, but i would just move on.
from there, the rest is easy!
i am attracted to any man that is funny.
only you can decide on this, woman.
why do you ask this question?
do not go telling everyone, just because you think that is the right thing to do.
a ten-year gap is just nice.
then move on if he still does not like you.
i see him every week but i just cannot talk to him.
that is because they feel insecure with less educated men.
for one thing, there goes your job if it does not work out.
and i just pray that it never passes!
it is only the ones that are not worth your time.
smaller, of course, and it is all about looks!
you guys do not have any reason to hate each other.
if you do not, you will always wonder.
some people choose not to due to their religion, others do not.
give it a chance, if you break up with them it will be harder to remain friends.
best of luck!
men who were not ready to commit.
this is a big day in both of your lives and it should not be done quickly and without thought.
i am fifty-five years old and still live at home with my mother, what is wrong with that?
one man willing to move twenty-one hours and fourteen hundred miles just to be with me.
i must not be unattractive enough.
that is alright, i am a giver.
it depends on what the woman wants.
remember that it takes two, not one.
if he did not like her and likes you, then he would have already broken up with her for you.
remain until the tavern closes, or visit a prison.
please do not miss out on this one.
because, believe it or not, women hate cocky men.
stick with what's inside of you.
it happened to me twice.
maybe you're young, i don't know.
no matter what he says, actions speak louder than words.
i like a big boned girl.
do not sell yourself, even if he is rich.
i just moved to sacramento. i am a homosexual male, age 30.
the people around you, including friends, should like you for who you are.
they like tiny women.
wait until you are older, and if you have the same feelings then you should go for it!
i am not that type of person, however i know plenty of people like that.
if you have to ask, then that is a negative.
you want to be together with someone else?
they are woman enough for a man, but they aren't as sophisticated as us.
does this mean that he likes me?
do not worry about him. concentrate in school so that you can learn, then worry about your boyfriend later.
i dated someone like that, so i know.
observe the way that she walks.
no, or any event i hope it is not so.
i would like to visit your country.
should i provide him with another chance at some point in time?
do you want to be in a relationship with the same man?
i went and there he was.
that is what i called it, but why?
that way you can still go by your last name!
both of you work hard to get it right!
i have told her that i liked her and she said she would not want to ruin the friendship.
you can join a community site with live chat and webcam chat.
show her your naked baby pictures.
it is very important to last at least thirty to forty-five minutes!
but i am not telling you that you have to be celibate until then.
if he is flirting with her, then okay, jump him.
i enjoy curly hair. i like running my fingers through it.
i want my wife to grow as well.
i suppose that is merely the way it is.
one woman, michelle, who most likely would not mind being named, said she did not believe in it.
i can simply stop caring about him and forget about him as though he meant nothing to me.
but he was rather busy after that.
i do not know what to do because she knows how much i care about him.
if you do eat something like that, then quit.
it could be that you need to urinate or a by-product of your last dream.
if he wants to wear my pants, he only has to ask.
if you were friends before and now have stronger feelings, then it should be alright.
also, i would like to try again.
decide which style of arrangements and flowers that you would like.
lie, lie, lie and then lie some more.
wait until you find that out for certain and then move on from there.
he should not care if you are at a dance together.
trust him and do not bring it up again.
most women are waiting for a man to tell her his true feelings.
i would like to meet women.
i frequently think about this issue.
i met a man one time in a huge rainstorm. it was very romantic.
some men like women like that and some do not.
it comes between three-play and five-play.
i feel senseless when i fall in love.
you are not in love if you have to ask.
if you begin to feel it happening, then start the foreplay again.
i do not understand. someone please give me the answer.
i saved $500-600 by doing my own flowers and it was simple.
i recently got divorced and so did he.
but ask a woman about the symptoms, because i am a man.
be genuine for the most part, but show some toughness, as that is what most women appreciate.
obey your feelings, they are never wrong.
they bother you all day.
see if he calls, sends an e-mail, or even cares.
you can do a civilian arrest answer.
usually, it is a spasm in your back.
by now, you might love your wife after everything you have endured together.
good luck, and i hope everything goes well!
tell them "i love you." it will tell you everything, if they wait to say it back.
attempt to ask her out again and notice her response.
there is no way to make someone fall in love with you.
ask her questions and do not monopolize the conversation.
when you first fall in love, you become giddy simply thinking about that person.
remember, there is more than one.
i think they look better than many of the nations that exist.
we got married all over again.
all in all, i do not think it matters.
i am sure not driving five hours to hang out unless i truly like her.
how often can you have intercourse with pam anderson?
i told her that i loved her and i truly meant it.
consider what good it brought about.
the think is, i am a person that does not like to break people's hearts.
giver her a rose and express your love.
i prefer a think one over a thin one.
remember, untill death do you part.
we will always find a life partner, that is why we usually attract someone with an opposite personality.
what are you talking about?
if you have to keep talking to him for another week, he may think that you two are married.
women don't need that much, just to be acknowledged and helped occasionally.
it seemed like that to me anyway.
do not be afraid to say no.
let him go as there are always more fish in the sea.
it really does not matter, but i am fine with a handful.
pick the one who loves you the most.
you released a thousand.
you can go to a bar and get intoxicated.
just give it some time and thought.
you should not leave them. teach them what to do to please you better.
you are speaking the truth.
kiss when you are ready.
julesac is funny and mean.
it seems that you have distanced yourself from her but are still friends.
do not forget to choose, and vote for the best answer!
do no try to figure it out, that is just the way it is.
i do not know. but i know of another website i visit.
alright, it depends how much feeling you have for this man.
he must be controlling.
it all depends on how interested the woman is, in the man.
try to get out and meet people.
usually it is not just one thing, it is multiple.
if you really admire them.
this question is for the men. (a) what size woman do you prefer?
it is not worth it, if all you do is argue.
what makes it worse, is that i dated him for four years.
the right woman will come along if you are patient.
if you do not love your husband any longer, than move on and make room for another man.
you can do more sexual things with your wife and it is not a sin.
she does not want you to like her solely for her good looks.
i want sex here and there.
women are more passionate during sex.
if you play with both at the same time, she will probably have sexual intercourse with you.
because he would not work, hit me, used guilt trips, and was a big mama's boy.
maybe because you are the most beautiful girl they have seen.
it really depends on if someone is vain or not.
i want someone that i can be myself with.
send me your picture and contact me.
stay away from the guy-friend.
the doctor cannot even believe it.
yes, especially when she vomited.
do not sweat it.
i could give you some advice?
if your love is fading, do something about it.
i will not be with someone who lost my trust.
only once have i told a girl that i loved her, and i meant it.
you married him for a reason.
you should rip off your shirt and do a tarzan style yell.
do not have sex.
it is acceptable in their culture.
always go with a friend.
you did not give us good information. do you all live in the same house?
looks are not everything and you should move on.
the most important thing is to be yourself.
yes, be disappointed and be angry.
i am sorry but i have never felt that way.
i sure would not like any woman who makes my life difficult.
or if he gets the tickets, then you get the popcorn.
practice, then ask how you are doing.
but, if you are sure then tell your parents first if you have not done so already.
i met mine in a carnival.
it sounds like a rhetorical question.
i believe everybody should keep their own name.
but your first kiss should feel like you are in heaven.
there is only trouble there.
i would like to know how to make a woman happy. can you give me some advice?
do not do anything that can hurt you.
of course you will make more money if you work hard.
please do not go up to her and tell her how attractive she is.
i do not believe that is a good idea, you are not there for that purpose.
walk up to her and say "hello, are you single?".
i believe that he would make a great valentine.
you should be prepared to let her go.
instead of just sitting there and waiting until you are a good one.
just talk to them, what are they going to do, slap you?
get a massage, and leave it all, haha..
well, if you really enjoy this boy, smile and speak politely with him.
take both of them out at the same time.
it happened to me and i am now seeing that person.
there are only two ways to make acquaintances.
you might be finished searching for the class of men that think the world of you.
preferably, someone who doesn't dislike you.
we attempted to move on, but it didn't occur.
when will people in this damaged world finally realize this?
i would not take the trouble to call him back.
attempt not to spend time with him and search for another man.
search for another attractive woman and she will be jealous.
therefore, in my opinion, you are not promiscuous.
colors have associations with feelings.
if she likes him over you, you should dump her. it is not his fault she is unfaithful.
if you do not contact me after 3 days, i might start to forget about you.
you will find a girl who has talents and is attractive.
there is no one you can trust more then a good friend.
start the day with breakfast and a good walk.
if she says yes, pick her up.
why do i hear some girls say that flowers are not going to last?
it might be interesting for them.
could it ever be the same?
it is not that bad; at least it is not bella.
could it possibly be because some men are liars and big mouths?
or you could just tell her and then have one of those fairy tale romances.
finally, a culture that has it correct.
my twin will not talk nor listen to me.
go ahead and get something that you cannot get rid of.
i am not thinking about him, but i am having dreams with him in them.
i think it would be passable for you to get a video/computer game.
you should go for it, and take the chance.
if he cannot, then take him to a place where they have music to slow dance to, or a dinner date.
i feel as if this is the most beautiful thing about family life.
it is your choice not to hate one. i dislike them, to say the least.
you should never get married without a prenuptual agreement.
you should pursue an active life and not waste my time.
is she saying the thinks you are too good for her?
relationships with men end, but friends are forever.
it could mean any number of things.
it is normal, because there are a lot of people who still like someone that they broke up with.
i would like to see what an african-american has to say about this.
men are daft, who knows why they do what they do.
you do not have to wait at all, if they gave you their phone number.
because we were, masters of the universe.
i am in love and i do not care who it, buddy the elf.
do not try to have both of the at once, no matter what.
if you truly wanted to be with him, you would not have to ask.
remember, being friends with someone online is okay, however, there are limits.
when my sister kisses someone, she closes her eyes to get prepared.
now me, i wouldn't marry any woman who didn't want to change her name, but that is just me.
small party for the family.
girls are perverts, they just hide it and act like it around other girls secretly.
i'm only in fifth grade.
but you do what you want.
do not do that, it will not work.
it is time to move on if they do not.
he has everything that i could ever want, handsome, financially secure, etc.
it is bad luck to see the bride before the wedding.
no, she isn't lying.
be quiet, and live the truest version of yourself.
he has his nose pierced.
i can't lift him, and he is only 185 pounds.
you should have a therapist for that.
perhaps some vulgar young men enjoy the younger asian ladies.
you should make an appointment with a therapist!
giving you ridiculous excuses, off of the wall! acting differently than he did before!
be tough and hang in there.
absolutely not, he is too hefty and i am undesirably frail.
basically, it is very unattractive if she is so inebriated that she becomes a promiscuous ragamuffin.
keep in touch by exchanging letters and emails, enjoy online chats and phone calls, and even sending each other packages.
you do not have to especially if you do not feel like it.
he dribbles, shoots, and scores two points.
giving it up just for him to stay with you is like selling your soul to the devil.
i cannot give you a wife view, but hopefully mine is just as good.
it also takes the pressure off of me to ask someone.
it depends on the woman, but it is better shaved.
please ask the question in english; i am unable to understand you.
hello, i am a male, but i will tell you a little bit.
i do like him a lot and i want to win him over, not push him away.
i like this man; however, i am uncertain whether he also likes me.
your avatar looks familiar to me.
i just cannot seem to move on even after six months.
perhaps he is concerned about rejection, and you should act as i would, which is to ask.
you must think about that, which should help you decide whether you can trust him.
a picture of the shape of a heart with you and her when you both first dated, that is special.
i am in college and he is my only source of income until i graduate.
listen, it is not easy because i got with my ex-boyfriend in 2nd grade, 4th grade, and 8th grade.
i have been with this girl for 8 months and we have not kissed, is that bad?
some guys do not like breasts at all.
or that she just desires to go out with other people?
and he has seen me every day for approximately four or five years!
there was his stop so he left the train.
you should take a chance because the worst outcome is that she says no.
i know, however, what i want in a relationship.
consider flirting and sending flowers and candies to yourself, and he may then ask you out.
also, i dislike it when my father is unhappy.
i feel bad because i know that i do snore sometimes. don't most people?
i like scott and need to know if i am in love.
if the two of you truly love each other, then you can work out all of your disagreements.
because neither one of you have the guts to call it quits yet.
however, that certainly does not mean that big girls can't be cute.
he is getting married this month.
those men are dolts and you do not want them anyway.
just ask, "will you go out with me?"
get married only after you have been with a man for more than two years.
a man has a penis, and a woman has a clitoris.
you need to seperate the bad thing and move on.
if i were mad, it would be easier to do.
if she tells the admininstration, i will be expelled because it is pakistan, and not america.
you should get to know her, and one of you will ask the other out.
like i said, he already knows that you like him, so just take a deep breath, and ask him.
maybe you and i can gt together sometime. perhaps even find love in one another.
i would be, but i am married.
play the field a little bit.
as everyone said, don't get married so early.
i just want to know, have you been to the doctor yet?
pay attention to what the other person says.
simply communicate with your spouse about this.
if you are interested in sixth graders, you are obviously young.
i was considering a medium pink color, but paired with what?
ask them if they would like to go somewhere with you.
i would like a trip to an amusement park, or a museum.
do goys prefer bigger women?
i like him.
it can work out, just not all the time.
should i break up with him because of his mother?
i accidentally did this before and my friend was mad that i deleted him!
i do not think i mind either way.
but that is her way. you could try it that way or you could just keep your eyes open.
there are some that do but you should be able to tell.
are you referring to your avatar?
i do not recall ever giving a girl a christmas gift unless i cared for her.
i do not know what to do.
attempt to be authentic and do not act ostentatiously.
simply proceed one step at a time. consider how he lost a something positive.
if only every man would watch "what women want" the would be a much happier place!
compliments, honesty, and focus on her.
i think he will crush him!
it means she is interested in him.
please try. i think you will be slapped mid-reach, or kicked in the groin.
she and i are both divorced.
does she want to see a picture of you right away?
it is better then giving her a fake number.
she need to move to massachusetts.
if you feel so strongly about it, perhaps you should not get married.
from the photographs i have seen, i would say maui or the bahamas.
the man i like is angry with me.
you are 13, do not concern yourself with it.
do not worry about calling him too much.
i am a guy and we like to chase women.
thank you in advance.
we always seems to push away the ones that we love.
they think that they can control other people's lives.
that is odd, but perhaps, i will talk to my friend by his locker.
i am not sure, how would you like to have an article forced into your derriere.
if a man cares about you, then he will call.
what is a special gift that i may give my future brother in law on his birthday?
it is probable he does not want to either.
hold on to her hands, gaze in her eyes and say it, however, only say this is you really love her.
some men do, others do not.
i would really like to know, if you could please help me.
the timing with the older man was not right, you will see.
generally kind and i will be disappointed if she is stupid.
it is one of the gifts that we are always able to give ourselves.
i do not believe trust has to be earned, because how is that even possible?
so, if that is you, you sincerely need to stop as that is most unorthodox.
do not allow her to dominate your life for she will simply have to learn to deal with it.
i have yahoo email, and that works for me.
i would suggest not worrying about it overmuch.
yes, the promiscuous women never had a chance.
when you can pass gas in front of the one with whom you are in a relationship.
it depends on their age.
any man that says that he would, is probably not being entirely honest with himself.
if you philander him, then the challnge is not there.
if you need you ex emotionally, then you are going to have some troubles.
she does not have to be younger than you, 20-32 will do.
try to use your brain and not your manhood, maybe she does not love you.
do not let your girlfriend know that you want her forever.
there are plenty of cheap ides out there; you just need to find what you like and work at it.
if you are skeptical about the performance piece of it, then do not do it.
try another woman and if it fails, then move back.
most often that will be guys around your age.
if you act like that all the time she might think you are desperate.
not everyone on here is in school.
tell him what you really want; that is what they tell me even though they never got to do that, so speak up.
should i make the first move or should i wait for him to make the first move?
what a typical double standard you have.
after a while you don't even see the color.
i haven't tried it yet but i am still trying to get up the nerve.
if you two are serious, asking her that question shouldn't bother her.
ask her out, what's up with that?
would you like to go out with me sometime?
yes, look me up if you are ever in florida.
i tell you, those were good times.
it is all about her. no, it should not be something that happens on a first date.
do you honestly want to spend the rest of your life with someone you argue with all the time?
if he comes to his senses, then great, if not, break up with him.
you are too good for them.
have sex with him because she likes him?
it depends on the age, but cds or dvds.
twenty years down the road, that is all you can be. so, start from the beginning.
i would like to visit the united states of america. what things would i need.
anyone who has any ideas, tips, or general information, please email me back.
you sound like a very lovely person, do not let these women drag you down.
you do not look, just go out, enjoys yourself, have fun, and a special woman will come along.
do not pursue it, he is getting married.
clear liquid turns yellow when it has dried.
if there is a short messaging system in your country, then find someone great at texting.
when she starts to close her eyes, kiss her on the lips. the rest is up to you!
please be honest with me. i can handle the truth.
have fun, but remember not to get so comfortable that what happens next is predictable.
it shows you how much they care about you.
tell her that you love her and miss her.
some enjoyable things to do include having coffee, lunch, site seeing, playing in the park, going to a movie matinee or museum or just walking, talking and playing.
what you want is a prostitute and you can find that in any corner of the world.
now we do so many things together and i do not know what to do.
if it fails, then you will be up a creek without a paddle.
at least for me, it has been the best thing.
if they apply, then try using some of these.
the worse thing he could have done, and did, was recently cheat on me.
if you are happy, then she should be happy. unless, he really is being bad to you.
we like it when men think about us, and perform tasks for us.
maybe he will call you back eventually, if you give him space.
tell him that you do not want a real relationship.
if you look creepy when you stare, the will think that you are leering.
i do not know about love but he certainly cares for you.
if a man truly respects you then he will understand.
consult yourself and come to a decision. if you can afford it then do it if you are inclined.
because he is the superhero that most resembles an average man.
sometimes the difficulties are worth it if there are more positives than negatives.
it is not wise to date work colleagues.
you should take a theory class.
let it take its course.
you are asking what their stance is about gay relationships?
i asked him if he was blowing me off.
guys will think you are attractive no matter what.
i do not think that not having sex with him will make him unfaithful toward you.
the safest rules of internet dating is to chat via email and the phone.
marriage is really about trust and communication.
ok, i have had this problem too.
what did you kiss?
could you trust him before?
do not make her hate you just to get your point across.
where have you been meeting these filipinas?
was it concidered love?
that way, you are not telling them what you specifically do not like about them.
if he is, then go ahead.
then, see if she is open for dinner and a movie.
hello, i apologize, i do not know. i wish the best of luck to the both of you.
however, every now and then, i find him looking at me.
this is sin, we started this.
fun includes eating meals, and i do not mean breakfast.
make a nice gesture, if there is no response, you will know what to do!
let him approach you first. if you approach it will make you look obsessive of him.
i prefer you not marry.
i lived him very much, and he loved me too. that is my love story.
you apprear desperate and you wil never find someone if you are desperate.
he says we are just friends.
looks do not matter unless you are trying to prove something.
i know that once you have sex with him, he is no longer a good friend.
the fact that a guy is self centered is a huge red flag to me.
do not rush it and feel all your emotions come alive.
it is a two-way street until you get in a relationship with them, and then you know which way it will be.
you have one child. are you married?
how can i stop being overtly fastidious about people?
perhaps some women would say that it hurts a lot.
that man is the right choice. i am going to ask him to go out with me.
so it was a excellent idea.
if she gets intoxicated then it is not a turn off.
because some women send men tiny messages without saying it clearly.
i would prefer if they left me alone, and i apologize that i got off-topic.
ask her to go do something that she is interested in, or see a movie that she would like.
you are a man, and i use that term lightly.
ha, ha. too bad it is not automatic, like msn or aol.
that is how they will respond, so yes. this is a bad situation for you and for him.
go back to that person at once before it is too late!
i, too, want to smack the smile off of her face!
ask him is he wants to dance with you.
she may think that looks unattractive. in my opinion, blue looks better.
ask him if you should go see a doctor.
i did not go out with him for a second date.
firstly, why was the relationship not terminated?
delay for what reason? proceed to accomplish your intent.
in the event he has no objection, what other person has a relevant viewpoint?
i believe i persist in feeling all-consuming romantic love for him.
i wished to never again have sexual activity.
it is critical that you do not seek revenge agains the one who wronged youl
i do not think you are ready if you have to ask other people.
i say those things and i am female.
you can save money with respect to flowers.
you will know in time, and i recommend seeing what happens for six months.
either that, or you are the only one he has a chance of having sex with.
well, from your list, i would have to choose "spiderman".
i was cheated on for three of those years.
all seniors believe freshman girls are loose. it is sad, but true.
if he says yes, then you can tell him.
impress her with affection and love.
if you have, what was it like?
celebrate valentine's day with happiness, gift-giving, and fun.
any woman looks attractive when standing beside an unattractive man.
when i move in i was asked out by my neighbor.
you probably should act because he appears to be shy.
it becomes more difficult as time passes.
if you act yourself and ask about what is happening, you might get a response.
there are several times that you love the man, but are not sure he also loved you.
if you are talking husband or the like, i would say tools, toys for his automobile and items related to sports.
that made me really angry, but i left.
me, i'll pick up the bill, if i can have your vote for the best answer.
okay. so what size of the breast does the general man enjoy, do you believe?
a lot of women date older men, so men feel insecure and date younger women.
did you go on a date?
you should tell your parents. you can not hide.
i want you to be mine.
i know someone who had that happen, and she still dated the guy.
my friend has a boyfriend who she talks to online and over the phone.
do you like false nails or manicured nails?
tell her. women like to hear the truth. good luck.
we can wrestle together and be best friends.
remain faithful to your husband. after all, you married him.
don't listen to any of these other people's answers.
i am a man, so i don't have to pay.
remember, no bird has ever tried to fly with one wing.
just be honest about your feelings towards her.
it depends. if you really love him you will probably want to draw it out.
if you or the other person is married, run!
no, men do not, but little boys do.
please help me win this debate against her!
my girlfriend is strange, but i love her anyways.
it is quite simple, just do what everyone else is doing.
it is time to forget about him, if you two are meant to be he will return to you.
after three days of that activity, i began to have problems with my back.
stay alive and get your old life back.
that's why i ask, why don't guys ever know what they want with any kind of relationship?
you might ask him out to lunch or a movie or something.
girls don't like guys who are all about themselves.
it depends, do you like either one?
i keep going on dates with men who turn out to be rude.
it is a choice, and you should do what is comfortable to you.
some people do not have it in them.
do what makes you happy.
i can not go.
therefore it must be love.
as you know, you should search for love but carefully.
do not ask her to perform an act for you; make her the one being noticed and adored.
women are impressed if you show care, respect, and honesty towards them.
tell the rude man to leave.
they think that way is the only right way.
good luck and stay calm.
if you want to stay married, you need to find yourself.
i do not care for him.
men with these characteristics typically become wife beaters if you disobey them.
first of all, i have four kids, so being a homemaker is more work than my regular job.
no, i have not. i prefer normal looking guys.
it definitely looks like he has feelings for you. do you show him how you feel? you should!
everything seems so open and hit and run these days with most people.
i have a problem in that i unload all of my junk up front. perhaps i told this guy too much.
the right date can save money on plenty of things.
if you truly love your man and want to work it out, then tell your past partner to respect that.
that only makes her easier to have sexual intercourse with.
i do not think you should try it.
simple honesty, love, and trying to be true to them.
it is more like 65% or 70% and not 90%.
i like the feeling of cuddling with a large woman.
why should men grow up if women expect men to act like that?
you can get him drunk.
is is not a problem if you ask her while at work or not.
stick with the thirteen and fourteen year old boys, they are more simple to control anyway, good luck.
you never let a man treat you the wrong way.
also, i am not a stay at home, romantic dinner kind of lady.
when i left him, i swore i would never get married, again.
pickup lines are unseemly. be yourself and compliment her a lot because women enjoy that.
you will be fine. have fun.
not all of the time. sometimes shave, it depends on the woman.
i love him but i think i am ready to move on and meet new guys.
wait another four years.
i hope i can see some of it soon.
i do not want to be mean.
you should wait a while before having kids.
i would enjoy having some fun with you, that is why i answered this silly question.
you should try to contact their question and answer team and they will help you through it; have a good day!
because women do not have sex often.
if he insists, then it means that he only wants to have sex.
looks definitely matter and anyone who says that they do not is likely lying.
making love is like living a fantasy.
when you are 18-20, sometimes you say what you do not mean.
try to make it yourself, when possible.
there is always an exception, correct?
she is not that into you anymore.
i seriously doubt that you are in love with that many men.
on average, i would say about 45% at first, but then once you get to know the person, perhaps 15%.
you should play sports with your male friends.
she will tell you if it is not alright.
i do not mean, do you believe women are beautiful?
how do i get him to stop bothering me and leave me be.
an intimate, adult toy, that way you can both enjoy it.
men that do not have hair appear as little boys to me, and it is not attractive whatsoever.
i agree, just kiss him, he will respond either way.
a good way is to try and imagine yourself without him or her.
it is not so important here in america.
well, if it was prior to his relationship with you, then obviously he was not being unfaithful at all.
man, how many times have i passed up a great opportunity because i worried about someone saying "no" to me?
because the white women are taking up all of the men!
your self-image is also very important.
have you ever had a pap smear?
good god how old are you?
but i think they both like me.
ok, first thing is that it sounds as if you guys are already married.
yes, jaime is going to ask rubi out, but it is not your business.
that is an indication. things such as that can cause it to be readily apparent.
you should take the time to become acquainted with both equally without dating either of them.
i would be very pleased to hear logical opinions on this topic. thank you.
if you care for the man then proceed.
enjoying yourself with male friends is acceptable.
so it is natural with that guy.
women take on too much, and sometimes they feel like they do it for nothing.
no, because i am not married yet.
let me know what you think.
if you are a homosexual then be a homosexual.
good luck and do not give up.
i like older women so i believe it is strange and wrong that they cannot go on a date with her.
i am merely curious about what everyone thinks.
i met my previous boyfriend by driving in a roundabout in another car.
you are going to loose your friend over a guy.
i did not think he would remember, it was casual when i said it.
do you like the country or city?
you can be together all day, and touch his feet.
i do not like being single. i watch everyone else have fun.
women are curious about sex with other women, even myself!
i do not know what you said. i was too lazy to read your response.
i hate it. i love the straight ones.
this is doctor izzy speaking. i love and adore plus-size women!
no words will make the situation better.
you should take action before it is too late.
to tell the truth, you will learn, but you must experience things.
navy pier and the museums are great to visit. there are also many great restaurants and hotels.
that is a sterotype, and i am not a country girl. i think i am attractive in my own way.
he will not turn you down.
i hope you read this well.
many men prefer curvy women, most of them are african american.
if she is interetsted, she will call you later.
no, you will not because you know he has cheating tendencies.
ask yourself that; if you know what i mean.
i find that if i try really hard i can see things i know are not there normally.
let us get coffee and talk, and we will take it from there.
just move on with your life and find someone else.
i will bet that you are not, but try to email me at ilikethickchix@yahoo.com and i will be honest.
this man and i have been on and off since last year.
i really care about you and i cannot stop thinking about you.
when you are ready, it is worth the wait.
if you do not know, then ask someone who would.
push away your fear and tell him.
that is a chance you are going to have to take.
so drink up, if you want to be attractive to losers, creeps and perverts!
good for nothing, but enjoying visually.
after awhile it passes and i still love him.
as you stated, it is your life.
even in divorce i am stuck with it!
just because he has potential to be a great boyfriend does not make him one.
sure, tell me more about yourself.
one minute you want to throttle the other person and the next you want to jump on them.
i like girls who are pretty or have a great personality.
people whose parents take care of them can be very lazy.
i do not know what she wants.
that sounded very complicated. please tell it again, but in simple terms.
demonstrate your skills to her.
if you can imagine him as the father of your children.
if you do not ask someone else then i may.
i am laughing because that is why i am single.
if you really do love him, then you would allow him to go.
if she does not want to be with you, then try to be her friend.
well, if he says that he is not, you should believe him.
let us get it out of the uncertain part.
i worked there for a time, and met the man of my dreams.
i have been with my husband for four year. we just recently got married in december of 2005.
focus on how things are and what would be best for you at this moment.
you will see that no matter how hurt you are, it is still the simplest reason as to why you smile.
i did not think that pakistan was that conservative.
i have to stop right away because i am ready to relieve myself.
do not tell him too soon.
we cannot answer if she means it.
i do not like men that does that all of the time.
you can make an easier decision, then.
i have had sex with many girls and some where not the best quality.
he dribbles, he shoots, and he scores two points.
talk to your best friend and see if it is alright.
is this a trick question?
i do not know. can i do anything about it?
people become husbands and wives for real reasons.
if he does not, then move on, there are way too many fish in the sea.
do you want to say that?
if you are not happy, you need to fix it or break up.
not all guys enjoy that, but some guys do.
i agree with udaman.
it sounds like you are selling yourself too much.
your girlfriend will thing that you are a jerk.
sometimes, but you must observe your boyfriend.
replaying everything you ever did to me, correct?
but do not merely sit around waiting for the phone to ring.
i was in a relationship with a man earlier this year and he became violent.
leave it alone. i do not care what she says. she is in enough pain.
how would anyone know if they do not know anything about you?
just find one that loves you too.
it never hurts to flirt!
we were spending a small amount of time together.
do not employ flirtatious dialogue; such behavior isn't appealing.
i adore those people since i'm male and i'm not required to invite a date to the affair.
woman, more men exist in the world with a fondness for overweight women, contrary to your beliefs.
the females that complain about the short existence of flowers are simply unappreciative.
you need to be with that person; you have found your true love.
i mean you should truly be her friend.
how can i get my sweetheart to show me that he loves me?
the bottom line is that you have to stop talking to him and stop thinking of him.
they have never met in person but she says they are in love.
do not do that over the phone or email.
i am not againt homosecuals, they are very good friends.
i met agirl recently, and i want to know if she likes me.
death is like a box full of cnady corn.
you need to try and make the best of what is going to come.
you need to move on with your life, or try to make it work with this person.
she is the love of my life, and i can not wait to spend the rest of my life with her.
since females experience thought via their brain activity.
i still have feelings for my ex and i'm furious with my cousin due to my ex now liking her.
the passage of time will reveal the truth. socialize with buddies, enjoy yourself, put it out of your thoughts.
therein lies the reason for my nearly non-existent chatroom attendance. i rarely go, save for a desire to be amused by the weirdos.
this is what i did, it was a big mistake on my part.
i have no idea where to begin!
he cheated, so i guess i can carry my husband.
if she calls just to ramble then tell her not to call so often!
that is all i have to say.
do you think you should be asking this question?
another option that i am considering is lime green.
i am referring to the two of you collectively.
i have a woman who is a close friend.
are you wanting to be someone you are not?
can you imagine yourself in bed with him at night?
i love that they like the challange.
it depends on the girl. fair skin ladies look extra pale if they have black hair.
i should do that, the next time i am dating someone.
do not listen to what anyone else try to tell you to do.
i really like this man. i am not sure if it is love or just an infatuation.
in my opinion, the bomb is much easier.
they have been fairly favorable years, not always the easiest.
do not forget to choose and vote for the best answer!
tell her why you like her!
did you turn gay or is it just a curiosity thing?
no, not if you have to ask.
it is a very long list.
he might enjoy the waiting, dreaming, and teasing.
to not get yourself into trouble.
if you would liek to talk, message me.
he likes to tease you abut pointless things.
do you believe he has the same feelings towards you?
from personal experience, most of the time someone ends up cheating on their partner.
they are often much worse then men.
i've heard from a few friends, that they've gotten married six months after meeting someone.
i don't know what you mean.
if you want kids, then homemaker.
what is the worst that could happen?
intellect, a chick with brain is just sexy.
his/her intelligence, the way they carry themselves, good looks and activeness.
yes, will you pay for me as well?
yes, i am proud of my long, black hair.
i was not going to let her win.
chances are if you like her as a friend, you will like her if you are in a relationship.
when you are wither her, just be yourself.
men think they are special and that only certain women are good enough for them.
find someone you like and ask them to be your valentine.
post more questions on yahoo anwers!
well, why do you like the one boy who picks on you?
i would say brokeback mountain; you will be happy even if it is a man.
size, shape, looks, and other surface features should not matter at all.
intercourse is not the only important thing in life.
you are most likely too good for him.
do you like him or not?
what's the reason for not simply requesting permission to exchange kisses with her?
who's qualified to classify country women as possessing more sex appeal?
well, i have no knowledge of your age, which would be of assistance.
merely contemplate those things you enjoy and provide the same in return, somewhat akin to a massage performed with one's tongue.
my response is as follows: (a) the majority of men have no affinity for seriously emaciated women.
you must cut your cousin and ex boyfriend off completely.
does his friends point at you when you are with him?
it is possible to enjoy giving pleasure instead of recieving it.
i keep thinking about being intimate with a girl.
it depends on if they are brunette or not.
is she simply trying to use you?
you can have a big penis and still be bad in bed.
get rid of the ex if you are dating a man you love right now.
it hurt extremely badly and i bled.
cuddling, kissing, fondling, and petting one another before sex.
when he does, you should explain to him that you want to be with him and it was a mistake to break-up.
my boyfriend loves me a lot and does not want to give me up.
you are already doing it, so why bother?
it was impressive on the hood of my car, at a waterfront, in a light rain.
i believe that you are likely a nice man, and she likely loves you a lot.
you are searching too hard or possibly looking in the wrong places; sign up for yahoo personals.
only if you desire it.
though if she does not have a reason then she is not your friend.
you need to find what is right for you and your partner(s).
you are definitely not a promiscuous woman, so do not worry.
girls to not think it is cool. they think that men who smoke are pathetic because they are killing themselves.
so, do you like asian food?
they do not mean to get them pregnant. however, they cannot keep it in their pants because they are pigs!
i like natural and real girls, not fake-looking, prissy drama queens.
take on how the world runs, and their desires to catch up to the ever expanding world.
that is too many, and selfish, you are desperate to try another one though, correct?
it is as if you decided to eat chocolate, and then complain about appearing overweight.
he loves you; you are aware of that?
my wife is a forgiving woman.
you order online and then the store brings it to you.
around three or four.
imagine that i am that man and be my girlfriend.
offer them the chance to discover you.
it is unusual, yes, but not bad.
i still love him. what should i do?
do not remain with him solely for the child.
never ignore her, always listen to her, and never change the subject. women really dislike that.
it can be good luck if that is the way that you want to look at it.
egotism is a man's attribute, you just have to live with it.
it sounds like you are going through a lot right now.
good luck but be sure to do your homework!
do not come here because it seems like it is a trap to me.
everywhere! just ask any girl passing by in thailand, but not in the united states.
this girl does not want a bad boy at all.
but i really need to be happy.
you are being dishonest by flirting with these pathetic desperately lonely men and you ought to be ashamed.
additionally, men sometimes think that they do not need you much until you are gone.
the only words i have are "good luck!"
you married your husband, i hope, because you love him.
i most enjoy expressing my feelings to women with poems. has anyone written one for their significant other?
why limit yourself to only one guy?
have you both agreed on doing this?
what is going to stop me when i have already done it?
he has to start over and earn your trust again.
i met his father in his side of the family.
we fell in love with them, and they treat us terribly, why?
i am one of those people who want to wait until they're in love with someone.
try to be nice first, women don't like being ignored.
you will hurt your loved ones if you continue to keep secrets.
some women like hairy men, some men like fat women, some women like skinny guys and vice-versa.
curves, especially if they have ample breasts and are soft. i cannot beat soft women.
never tell her she is fat.
you are a mother, please act like one.
others believe society dictates what others think, but i do not care.
i give them two months. they will get over you.
do not know, but daniel k has never read manga.
that is good, it is similar to getting your father's blessing.
i prefer intelligent, pleasant, and captivating women.
i will be your significant other is you come to me town.
this generation is not too bright.
you will have to pay the price.
they are very much in love.
every time i see an advertisement for malaysia air, i go crazy.
he asked me on a date in a very nice way.
try talking to her and asking her to hang out as friends. see if the relationship ends up going somewhere.
this is a very hard choice because there are many temptations.
not what you could become just because she says so.
both of you should speak privately and personally, you need to clear each other's side, do it now.
well, the one i enjoyed goes something like this.
do not attempt to experience sexual relations.
just stay calm, a bit of hard to get may help!
if you relationship lasts a year, i would assume you should be ready.
in any event, i married my husband, and wonder if you know the reasons in addition to love.
you need to move on and enter a relationship with someone who does not hate you.
you cannot, so let us operate on an assumption.
yes, we like flowers that are pretty and smell nice.
should i date him or not? it is a younger guy vs an older woman.
those other replies are cocky. i am a much better person.
lime green would be best for a summer wedding.
but let them marry, if they cannot exercise self-control.
i have the most terrible time sleeping, because my boyfriend snores!
you may not think so, but yes!
we have no room for messed up individuals like this in our society.
the best and easiest way is to fly, or drive, to las vegas, and get married there.
his answer is good enough for me.
no single man can give you what you want.
leave him if he does not start acting right.
if you are attractive you can show him your breasts.
a lot of men are like that and are just looking for sex.
(i make a lot of mistakes), but she does not forget.
unless you are desperate, wait for him to ask you out.
are you asking if i like you?
make sure it is your decision.
can you get someone to help her- her parents or friends?
how intoxicated what she?
women love men who are self confident.
i am doing this for some points.
if you don't know each other well, then there is no way you would connect.
i would say that is was real, and is worth having a relationship. good luck to you!
but if you are used to it and you enjoy it, then go along with it.
because it is buy one, take one.
and lastly, does he always happen to be staring?
it sounds false, but i swear, women enjoy it.
you have the unintelligent ones out there that think skinny is better.
however, i always believed the fact there is a huge difference between having sex and making love.
you have to make yourself walk away.
in my case, i think around 80%.
i like it when they lean in, and give me a soft kiss on the forehead.
i can not see life without my husband.
it is prettier and smooth as silk.
flowers are nice, even if the do not last long.
it is sounding like he is having too much fun while you are away.
why do you not simply leave the girl alone?
maybe you should try dating girls, if guys offend you so much.
i also do not have a single girlfriend.
just remember: go for men who are themselves, and only themselves!
they feel that they are better than women, but they are wrong.
that does not mean that you should let them in.
it is always in the back of your mind.
her friend to talk with her on the phone?
getting married and having children can wait, our studies cannot.
you need to repeat this a few times.
the majority of males prefer females that enjoy sex.
don't look back. enjoy the acquaintances you currently have.
no greater good, nor bad is your own personal belief.
i'm unsure concerning what i should do.
agreed, it is an unhealthy behavior.
delay doing so until you reach age 25. your appeal will not diminish in such time.
my eternally close friend despises my partner and hopes for the dissolution of our relationship, but it will not occur.
be authentic and restful. such behavior is that which we enjoy.
they should try taking our last names.
once you have children, you will need to decide on a last name.
he wants to continue.
i pick the domestic goddess.
ask her for another date after claess.
life is too short, so live it to the fullest and have faith.
as a man, i feel the same way because of who i am.
call him if you feel that level of attraction to him.
if you start with a basic question, you can go from there.
did you tell more people?
my friend want to kiss their boyfriends.
you can ask if you are a good kisser.
i am at your service anytime, we will not regret it.
you need to put it in again and add it back, just like the first time.
you can share this with your mom or dad.
and do not fall for the "alcoholic only on weekends" line that the guy is giving you.
you sort of put yourself out there to get hurt, unless you know him fairly well.
personally, i prefer a and b cups.
be her friend first, then observe where it goes.
do not even listen to what people, not merely males, state, but observe how they act.
do you feel in that manner?
alas, if a male inquires of you, do not be frightened to state negatively.
obviously, she does not desire you if you know she is partial towards the other male.
there are lots of things that make a woman dislike sexual intercourse.
not all men get bored and move on.
but there is no better person to marry someday than your best friend!
depending on what you are looking for, the relationship may be friendship only.
i did this with my current beau.
it does not mean that you cannot love another.
in my opinion, you should divorce that man, he has no honor and he does not love you.
basically, men just want a companion for unfettered copulation.
you will have to ask him for it again if nothing else works.
it is your personality and you need to keep it; whether a boy goes out with you or not should not determine how you act.
you have to look within yourself for the answer.
if the man is worthy enough, you will not need to.
i am confused and do not know what to do because i hate for the girl to be that way.
shop around for invitations and anything else.
he then asked me "could i come with you?'.
just go with your feelings. if you like her so much, then go for it.
so, i am only myself around men i am not attracted to, and you know the outcome.
i hope you find a nice girl.
alright, i have been attracted to this girl since i was in the ninth grade.
to all of my fellow woman at cone: a big "hi!" and a hug!
if she's fond of him, a motivation exists.
if attending the cinema is exceptional for you as a couple, take part in that activity.
it simply appears that you don the trousers.
did you relay to her the annoying nature of her daily check-ins with you?
for that same reason that thin girls prefer boys who are slender and toned.
he handed his cellular phone to me and had me put my telephone number in it.
go to hawaii, or you could pay someone.
i do not understand why people think that it is wrong.
keep searching for someone who believes in romance, she is out there.
you need to be shot if you plan to cheat on your wife.
well, he already knows that you admire him. has he said anything about it?
confront ask him, and that way you will know.
i would say, that it is more of a trust issue.
continuously attempt to impress her.
because you are punished, you get no television for a month.
it is better than the one on top of me.
it did not matter as we are just friends.
you need to go to school. you can still come home or call you friends and family.
the one that pick on you usually likes you.
my views changed when i met my true love.
do you take baths? do you know how to speak?
i like him and he says he would date me if i was single.
discard him, it would be better.
it's the only time in your life, you're able to live out true love!
people had questioned me, why was i rushing?
has he discarded women with similarity before?
i'm thirty six currently. i'm still in therapy regarding it.
do not be one of those controlling mothers.
have you ever thought of that?
it has been six months, is it normal that i still like him?
look for a man that is handsome.
it is really sweet, just what you are looking for.
is there a reason why you are not with the babys father?
you are wasting your health, because girls do not like that.
i prefr a size c or d. anythign bigger is a waste.
i think they do.
do not be rude.
you should most likely look for someone in a public place where you feel most comfortable.
one time a guy asked me if i minded if we cuddled.
did you ask about the score of the last game?
some couples never get to the comfortable and boring stage.
i always state that you should not do things if you are going to regret them later on.
even the following day would be alright.
well, all you are missing is a smile worth a million dollars.
i hear you, fountain, something similar happened to me.
although, i do not really like girls all that much.
be really nice, give eye contact, and smile often. i hope this helps!
i wonder why he shaved them but in the end, they're his legs!
best of luck to both of you.
this is just why i have been hurt many times.
i prefer natural appearances, rather than a full face of makeup.
i prefer 10 years younger, who wants to be with an older woman?
ask your friend if it will be okay with them.
many people will probably reject you.
downtown houston about every weekend because of the clubs.
who said women do not feel anything?
do not start with her looks, sir.
you also should move on if they have.
try flirting to see how he responds.
i am waiting until i am married, but when is it too far?
there is nothing wrong with her asking for your telephone number.
also, you do not nee to be an overly happy, hyperactive person.
i do not want to just randomly walk up and say "will you go out with me?".
then comes the fun part, him making it up to you.
give at least 5 minutes for kissing and hugging and maybe some licking too.
i can't help any more unless i have more information.
because i say no on avatars.
some girls prefer gifts that won't die on them, something that lasts.
he is likely wondering if you are interested in him at all; flirt back with him.
i feel silly, nerdy, and happy.
if you are a whore, then he is also one; i personally do not think that you are one though.
there are some men who only say the "l word" if they mean it.
i do not need a trophy girl; i want a companion.
as a man, i may have some insight.
believe in yourself, be confident, don't act arrogantly, and always listen to what she is saying.
he asked if i would like to use his chapstick.
there isn't a proper way to kiss someone.
we do not think about things until later; and, this is because we love them.
i do not know as i have the same issue.
what was the mistake that you took part in?
it is like getting rid of a drug habit.
speak to him, and it would not seem psychotic because you have known each other for some time.
definitely for the first answer, that girl answered for me.
or, what about the blue and green?
a life of your own..a life that you have been missing out on.
confusing, yeah, i believe you are right.
the deal is, you do not have to ask her to date to date her.
perhaps he is going to telephone you!
tell her, but be as polite as possible.
i lost my virginity in a park when i was sixteen years old.
what guy does not like big breasts?
you should be proud of yourself.
men work and fix things, but what else can you do?
we do not know what you look like!
if you could have four qualities in your woman, what would they be?
look online or check your local newspaper and you will find many things for the wedding.
if she sits on your best friend's lap because she is drunk, then yes that is a turn off.
should i see my boyfriend?
you will find a man who really deserves you one day.
well, you and that sexy perfume you wear.
if he isn't and you are still not ready, then screw him!
why do they want it state sanctioned?
she still lets me play with my trucks and watch cartoons!
you need to move on, but you can still love him.
see if the guy you like is willing to go out of his way for you.
if anyone knows the answer, please let me know.
i never knew that life could be so great!
and he said he would call me back.
choose the one you like the most.
disable the pop-up blocker.
if you truely love him you will tell him.
who knows, but i would absolutely love for that to be done to me.
what should i do to have her?
sir, you have to deal with it and introduce yourself.
there are films that i have not seen yet.
i believe it is completely dependent upon age and upbringing.
and, that will be simply intercourse.
my male paramour was sincerely my friend first, and it is complete bliss.
what does it matter what anyone else believes?
also, try getting a few blonde highlights.
let it all out. i use art to vent problems.
if she enjoys music, make a special cd or tape for her.
it could be. choose one and explain why?
do not worry what other people say.
it is my opinion that a lot of women enjoy receiving flowers.
i cannot explain it but it does not have anything to do with them being young, vulnerable, or submissive.
either let him go or date his brother.
there absolutely are, you just have to look.
you can purchase them at staples for $35.
your child is going to have a difficult time growing up without a father.
my friend says i am too nice, and should tell them no.
my girlfriend always tells me that she loves me when we are passing notes during class, but not in a confrontational way.
that is correct, the right relationship happened on its own.
you will look quite foolish.
no, and you should not care. if you like him, then stay with him.
i think you should be yourself, have self-esteem, and self-confidence.
anything that is not nailed down.
make it your top priority to see her, if you really want to be with her that badly.
one of my best friends had a crush on my big sister a few months ago.
should i just let this go and move on?
their friends, on the other hand, are a different story.
yes, i do and i think anyone would.
my cousin went online and met some strange older pervert who said he was a sexy teen.
help me choose my neighbor's wife!
i have long black hair, i love it, and so does my husband.
you care about your family, and your family cares for you.
ugly men just go for any woman available.
in the middle of the river, there were lots of people watching!
eye contact is the key point.
it is really a matter of what the man is attracted to.
it gives us this feeling that you may not be strong enough.
he may love you, but he also may want to disappoint his father.
some men don't think of their partner when they just get to it.
maybe the skinny girl was a mean person and she wasn't.
doing that does sound rather feminine.
if you want to enjoy your time, consider checking out some night clubs, restaurants, or gyms.
there are many good women available. you just have to look in the right places.
everyone has to break up at some point.
you win some and you lose some. take it with a grain of salt and be more careful next time.
happy birthday to you.
i just need someone to help me figure this out.
pick the one that treats you better.
i like a sixth grade boy too!
if you end it, he may not be your companion, that is why i do not enter romantic relatinos with companions.
attempt to emphaszie yourself more often, but you have to do far more than simple eye contact.
do what is best for you and him.
poor teeth, horrible breath, and deplorable body odor.
nobody needs to know that!
if i have to ask then i will leave and end the relationship and move on with my life.
do not misunderstand me.
i asked if he still liked me and he said he did but did not act that way.
where am i going with this?
keep getting a younger and younger woman, men. as your woman gets older, get a new one.
you know that is if you do not play the guilt trip.
that does not mean that it is the right thing to do; it only makes us human.
this is a mistake that cannot be undone!
practice unwrapping starburst with your tongue, and then tying cherry stems with your tongue.
did you catch her looking at you?
i know three men with whom i could probably get away with doing that.
you should ask her out or tell you that you like or admire her.
if he is going to be an on and off partner, then i suggest that you break off ties for good.
if they do not, then you will have to continue with your life.
i have never attended it.
compliment her and ask for her name. do not behave strangely. act as though you are the most suave man in existence.
she calls him often.
how should i approach her so she does not think i am another guy hitting on her?
if you wait a little while before dating guys, you might enjoy it more.
it is not cool to act better then someone else.
you do not have to make a decision about what to do.
why should i hide it?
some men do not like to dance.
truly, she is not your friend, because she will not stop annoying you.
i wish i had listened to my friends.
after how much time you can conclude that it takes too long, and she is not really interested?
do i want to be in love?
why do they want to be married?
that is a no-brainer, and nice picture of george clooney on your profile.
some women cannot seem to find men their own age attractive.
some do, but i would rather have a pair that was not too big.
it sounds like both of you are comfortable with the ways things are.
yes, it looks extremely beautiful on almost any woman.
sometimes it is better to be very good friends first to make sure that you will be happy around each other.
my question is, "will i always feel that way?"
a tremendous example would be faith hill's, "love ain't like that."
don't ask that question, if you don't want your feelings to be hurt.
she should be accepting of all your many facets if she loves you.
i think it is really attractive when a man shaves his legs.
if you two still keep in touch, i think you should maybe cease contact.
i like austin and asked my friend claudia to see if he likes me.
you are hurting the romance by asking that question. you should just focus on having fun together.
trust me, he is a player and no good.
it depends on the person. they like different kinds of people, but not those who are self-centered, like you are.
that is fantastic news! maybe you should act in the first movie.
should he refuse your request, his value is too low to begin with.
well, simply approach her.
it's a beneficial notion to consistently practice honesty...not to mention, the majority of men i'm familiar with don't mind being referred to as attractive.
they're aware the females will not pursue them like they will attractive or moneyed men who land a slew of women.
just face him and ask whether he would like to see a film.
that is why it is called making love.
he will know if you smile at him once in a while.
most girls are polite, and if she is, she will answer it.
i would because you resemble a close friend of mine.
hello, when shall we have dinner together?
i think most men do not care, but it does depend on the individual person.
it will work out if you want it to.
give up if he does not want to dance.
i believe that the man should take the first initiative in a relationship.
if you do not have a boyfriend it would make you seem easy.
take advice from a military girl and wait.
you can never tell, they never show affection unless there is something that they want.
i am forty-nine years of age and am looking for a beautiful woman to spend my time with and possibly more.
do you mean to seem more sexy?
go to'deleted items', it should be there.
i wonder if this is a red flag of who this man truly is.
perhaps because your name is freakgirl. if you show your face, then maybe not. no hard feelings.
i have been there and done that. trust me, that is going to be extremely painful.
do you love her deeply?
you can ask that question to your cell mate.
you can only see a man get emotional when he is with his lady love.
i have done it, and it was a lot of fun.
you have to let the person know who you are and what you want.
i would be crazy if she called me 5 times a day.
hang on there for one that appreciates you.
my mom books them all of the time through the email:pat@alanatvl.com
besides don't you think he has enough to worry about?
i have been in a relationship with a man who is younger than me.
men pretend to love in order to have intercourse; women pretend to enjoy intercourse in order to get love.
it must become annoying after a time.
everybody enjoys being called attractive, even if they will not admit it.
yes, but it depends on the man.
perhaps because you simply think they are sexually attractive when they run on the field.
you are too young to be speaking of kissing already.
i will most likely inform her soon because she is my best friend. in any case, any help would be appreciated.
i agree with the other person before anyone comes to harm.
i am ready to move on but i love him to much to do so.
go out and do all of the things that you could not when you were with him or her.
it is apparent that men are not much better.
perhaps you could inform him that you simply want to be friends with benefits.
try playing, "truth or dare," together.
he sounds like he is a manipulative simpleton.
you should try foreplay, it slows down the pace.
death is similar to a large black bag, full of drugs.
where do you live? i could come over and you could practice kissing me.
no, you won't get hurt. i was married to a complete jerk!
it sounds like you really love her, so there is no need to forget her.
tell him that you want to be friends, and that you are very disappointed that he would act the way he did.
don't do things you do not want others to know about. things always end up becoming public.
and why does chest hair exist?
as for now, i believe he is angry, hurt, upset, and no longer interested in you.
give your brother some money and tell him to leave.
no offense, but it sounds like a woman's name, but i mean no disrespect.
ask her on a date.
take her out and get to know her, and the nask her out.
people do not like their emotions played with.
practice by unwrapping starburst wrappers with your tongue.
i only want points.
that is not entirely true. it is simply that most girls are discreet about it.
that is dependent on whether you are physically attractive.
i informed him that it was too late. other than that, i would not mind receiving flowers at times.
"believe in" is a strange way to phrase it.
why can men (or boys in your case) not ever say the word "love"?
enjoy the age you are now, and do not worry about this.
i am 19, and i like anyone up to 30.
i had a friend in the same situation.
females are as dirty minded, trust me.
you should not go out with a man because you "need" to.
so what you are saying is that she does not want to be more than boyfriend and girlfriend?
is it usually about a year, before both people begin to feel that comfortable, commonplace stage?
probably, because i knew that all of my girlfriends were not truly, "the one," until i met my wife.
in my opinion, as long as you do not base your relationship on lovemaking, then it is okay.
why would some men do that?
if you are the real man, then breast size should not matter.
avoid men who can't be open about their feelings.
ask for permission, and watch how fast she rejects you.
my husband likes my personality.
my mother has cancer as well, this is too personal for me.
be your best self, if he is impressed or likes you, then he will talk back.
you do not ever want anyone else but that person.
why do you not try talking to and even seeing other men, just to see his reaction.
it is okay to kiss on the first date.
men have an issue with secrets.
i had someone get quite rude with me because i was still seeing people?
so, how do i just kiss him?
i am the maid of honor for my only sister and i desire for it to be perfect!
unless it is with the inappropriate man.
