are you posing a rhetorical question?
men pretend to love in order to have intercourse; women pretend to enjoy intercourse in order to get love.
i do not intend to be mean.
i would estimate an average of 45% initially but then, once you become acquainted with the person, perhaps 15%.
because some women send subtle messages to men rather than being clear.

ask him if you should go see a doctor.

he played a good game of basketball.
do not worry.
are you someone who enjoys arguing and fighting?
if his affections tended away from her and toward you, he likely would've terminated the romance to be with you.

one man willing to move twenty-one hours and fourteen hundred miles just to be with me.
have you seen a doctor yet?
perhaps she is not a shrew, but the thin woman definitely was.
you should pursue an active life and not waste my time.
it is comparable to over-indulging in chocolate and then complaining because you have gained weight.
i traveled there and he was present.
if he is single, go for it.
if you do not obey men like this, they typically become the sort who beat their wives.
are you or are you not attracted to him?

do you believe he has the same feelings towards you?
some men only say that word, if they mean it.
it appears that he likes you, and should should show him how you feel.
i am of the opinion that everyone should keep their own name.
friends are forever because guys come and go.
try to imagine that it was considered love.
i believe you should be ready even if your relationship survives the four seasons.
all right, presently certain men like women of that type and others, not as much.
if you want children, then be a homemaker.
younger men and older women, good idea or not?
he wants to continue.
you need to remain faithful to your husband. he is the one the you swore vows to.
therefore, there is no alternative to the proper labeling of'love.'
also, your self-image is very important.
i say those things and i am female.
trust me, girls can be just as perverted.
flowers are nice, even if the do not last long.
there are films that i have yet to see.
she is a very sweet girl, just the person you are looking for!

no disrespect intended; but, that does sound like a lady's name.
i would not take the trouble to call him back.
no women i'm attracted to in my list, therefore i choose my neighbors spouse.
marraige is about trust and communication.
do not listen to anyone else's advice.
what should i do to be successful with her?
give them a rose and express your love for them.
it is unusual, i agree, however it is nothing bad.
you need to see discern what's correct for you both.
they are woman enough for a man, but they aren't as sophisticated as us.
exactly, especially when she became sick.
due to...as you're aware...attempt to look for your beloved...however, use caution!
i cannot assist any further without more information.
kissing is something you cannot do wrong or right.
take time to decide.
enjoying yourself with male friends is acceptable.
merely contemplate those things you enjoy and provide the same in return, somewhat akin to a massage performed with one's tongue.
my significant other was definitely my friend first. that makes it complete euphoria.
i would say, that it is more of a trust issue.
i need someone to assist me in figuring this out.
then move on if he still does not like you.
he probably isn't interested either.
try to make it yourself whenever possible.
can you do anything else besides work and fix things?
i told her i sincerely loved her.
it seems that all of the male senior students think that freshmen girls are promiscuous, which unfortunate.
so, how do i simply kiss him?

it is a very long list.
i would say brokeback mountain; you will be happy even if it is a man.
if you do not base your relationship on intercourse, then it is ok.
i will most likely inform her soon because she is my best friend. in any case, any help would be appreciated.
correct, also it is a portender of misfortune to glimpse the betrothed at the marriage ceremony.
hold on and stay strong and good luck!
um, modest get-together for relatives.
if you are skeptical about the performance piece of it, then do not do it.
i am married now.
i believe it is completely dependent upon age and upbringing.
once you have children, you will need to decide on a last name.
your child will find it difficult enough growing up without a father.
bald men look like children to me, i don't find it attractive.
you should give it a chance. if you end up breaking up with that person, it will be harder to be friends with them.
ask what the score of the last game was.
if you are dating the guy you love you need to get rid of your ex.

deceive and mislead and then fabricate some more.
they have not performed previously and the pleasure is twice as nice!
my wife does not like to wear those brands.
we are unaware of what you look like.
because opposites attract and we always find a partner for life.
i think this is better than my personal life.
don't go anywhere with you new date that you went with your ex.
speak with your best friend and determine if it is agreeable.

no, because i am not yet married.

you should not get married if you feel this strongly about it.
it's strongly dependent on whether or not a person is vain.
you need to move on and enter a relationship with someone who does not hate you.
you should becom acquainted with her and sooner or later one of you will ask the other out.
i asked him if he was blowing me off.
perhaps some vulgar young men enjoy the younger asian ladies.
make sure it is your decision.
tell him you are looking to keep it casual.
is he not treating you well? you should be happy.
this situation is a challenging one with lots of problems.
they have been fairly favorable years, not always the easiest.
we have seen each other, everyday, for approximately four to five years.

you should take action before it is too late.
this woman doesn't want a man who deceives her.
i'd enjoy hearing the viewpoint of an african american woman regarding this subject.
please help me win this debate against her!
almost without exception (not constantly) those are men similar in age to yourself, more or less.
when will pepole begin to realize this?
i'm unsure concerning what i should do.
you visit a bar and drink until you are inebriated.
i behaved as such in the company of my present romantic partner.
if you have to ask, then that is a negative.
do not sit there and wait untill he realizes that you are a good one.
even though i am getting divorced, i am still stuck with this.
you will be fine. enjoy yourself.
your girlfriend will only think that you are being a jerk.
you can't fix the relationship with her parents, but you may be able to fix the relationship with her friends. why do you ask?
personally now, i would refrain from wedding any female unwilling to relinquish her surname, however, that is merely my feeling.
perhaps you should attempt to pursue young women, given the tendency by men to be offensive.
i went out with my ex for three years and then he/she cheated.

when he does, you should explain to him that you want to be with him and it was a mistake to break-up.
my friend tells me that i am too nice, and that i should tell him no.
but, because there is always an exception, is there not?
not all men, however some men do.
by doing so, you're still able to retain your surname.
approach her, say hello, and ask if she is single.
that really stimulated me sexually, but i ran away.
girls who are heavier can still be attractive.
not every participant present is attending educational courses.
practice unwrapping starburst and tying cherry stems, with your tongue.
if you keep on talking to him for another week, then he is going to think he is married to you.
i will pay if i can get your vote for best answer.
you should look for somewhere in public, where you will feel most comfortable.
flirt with him and gauge his reaction.
and it eases the pressure i'm feeling to invite somebody.
please say you will go out with me.
she does not forget my mistakes.
