just be her bff 4 real.
do you really want an answer?
men fake love to get laid, women fake orgasms to get love.
i wasn't trying to be a jerk.
it's a little less than 50/50 at the start, but once you get to know each other, 15% seems more likely.
some ladies just hint at what they want and expect the men to figure it out.
how about we grab some starbucks and talk, and see what happens?
i hate seeing my daddy sad :(
ask him if u should go see a dr.

if the good is better than the bad, its worth it
only if both of you agree
this girl michelle who don't care if her name's in it, said she didn't buy it for a second.

you're right it's realy confusing
how i convince my lover to show his love for me??
i mean, if you're that into them, sure
dun sell yourself out, girl, his money don't matter that much
don't let these girls hurt your feelings, you sound like an upstanding dude
i dunno, but there's another site that i go to for that
nah, man, think hard about how many arrogant chicks there are around
you could look easy if you don't have a guy.
then he's like do you want to use my chapstick?
take her hands and look in her eyes and say it if you mean it.
don't ever let a guy treat you bad.
don't think so, he's too big and i'm a weakling.
tell him when and if he says yes!
what mistake did u make?
tehres a song by king called only your mother loves you
why do we stay when theyre mean to us after we've falllen in love?
if youve done it, how was it?
its not really a turnoff when she gets super drunk
i guess if thats what you want
its just like trying to ditch a bad drug habit
i need to try that dating trick next time for sure
just let me know what you want
yall are both good with how things are going so thats good.
dont let her take over ur life, she will just have to deal!!
if hes not into you, there are plenty of other men out there who are.
no guy can give you everything you want...
you need to "find urself" if you wanna stay married.
start with a boring question and just keep it going!
ask if they want to travel somewhere with you.
just put some trust in him, and let it go.
i'm building up the courage to go for it.
find the person who loves you as much as you love them.
i'll be your girl if you come to my town.
stay far far away from him.
it's your choice man, but i hate all of them.
i say around 3 or 4
i don't know..do you want something shoved in your butt?
he told that woman he's a player.
my ex's made me realize why my wife was "the one".
don't be greedy and take both of them at the same time.
having sex is not the only thing that matters in life.
i use yahoo for my email and it works fine for me.
its just fun for me
he was a little busy after
thats just fucking sex
dont let her know you think shes hot
sounds like you're goin thru a lot right now
but u should ask a girl about the symptoms bc im a boy
i use to always feel the same thing but everything changed when i met my true luv!!
men are dumb!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! who the hell know what theyre thinking when then do what they do
marry your bf if it doesn't work with anyone else. good choice
well i don’t want to just run up and ask will you go oit with me??
unless you reaaalllyyy know the guy your gonna get hurt.
redo it the same way you did it put it in there
your beliefs aren’t good or bad.
they're annoying all day.
go to hawaii or pay someone.
their intelligence, their character, and looks make up for how attractive they are.
i can just forget about him like it's nothing.
is it like a clear liquid that gets yellow when it ends up drying?
do you hate it if she sits on you bff's lap when drunk?
if it was before u were dating, he wasn’t cheating
he was a control freak
one of the gifts we can give ourselves - determination.
you should only marry a man after you been with him for 2 yrs.
to my girls at cone, hi and hugzzz!!!
be yourself at all times
say it slow and repeat
a perv hit on me
some dudes are dumb
there are plenty of fish in the sea
either make up or move on
dude you've never talked to her, how can you love her
finda cute girl who can sing
you arent a slut
true love will happen to you, this time.
look up the answer on your own, dude.
2 months, and they will have moved on from you.
you won't even be able to tell what color it is once time has passed.
he wants to know if u like him
if she doesnt like u.....
your not a slut. dont fret
u cant force another to like u
break up and focus on others
have you had a pap smear?
i can say "yes" and i have long black hair and i'm proud!
my friend is in the same position...
maybe your young... idk.
i’m anonymous but i’ve been working with this person for a while.
i don’t get the question, someone answer.
if you love him for real, you’ll tell him
if you really like her, go with your feelings
if you think u can afford it, go for it if you want
stay alive and get things back to normal
what are you saying about her
not flirt. no one likes it
i think some women would tell you that it's pretty hurtful
tell him what you're all about. you always hear that, but they never do it. take the plunge and just say it.
it's be easier if i were more pissed off!!!!1
if they've forgotten about you, then forget about them too
your punishment - no tv for a month.
you've known each other for a long time it won't seem crazy
that's just the way she is. u could try it or just keep watching.
i still don't get it. can u say it again?
u have to give them a chance to see all your talents
wrong man could be a problem
my bf doesnt want to lose me cause he loves me a lot
it kinda matters if they're brunette or not
it'll get played out at some point
we don't admit it, but we all want to know we are sexy, sexy beasts.
i love dancing at the clubs in downtown huston
good luck and don't forget to do your homework!
i don't like it when women use too much makeup, they are beautiful naturally.
if you want him, go get him.
but now me and her are both divorced
um who said women don't have feelings???
actions are always better then jus words!
i'm thinking a regular pink color... but what should go with it?
see if he calls you or emails you or if he even cares!
don't ignore her always listen to her and don't change the subject!!
he is my only way to get money till i graduate from college
she'll let you know if it isn't okay
i don't care either way!
don't eat where you shit.
i'm gonna get blonde highlights done.
forget about it, focus on school and your bf.
b, anyone who chooses something else is lying.
this was a bad idea..
i need at least 5 minutes of groping.
what's a dope prez for my bro in laws bday?
don't be a show off, but be yourself!
good luck. hope it works out!
if dey do not, den yuh will have tuh continue wit' your life
your first kiss, howevuh, should be heavenly
in a family life, dis is de most beautiful
most impawhtantly, be genuine
i got 3 guys who i can do that with.
you can't hide that from your parents, so just tell them.
it's doctor izzy and i love bigger women!
get mad if he flirts with her
stay with the 14 or 13 yo boys
tell him u just wanna be friends, and your disappointed by him being so dumb
it's kinda nice...like getting your dad's blessing.
wait for him or you'll seem desperate
i like this guy, dunno if it's just a crush or love.
if he keeps it up, you can tell he was only after sex
if i try and can see a reality that isn't real
i love have fun wit you so i answered this?
how u feel
give your bro som $$ and get rid of him
he might call
you can try to think about life without them, that's something.
if u wanna be around her so much then u have to prioritize it
i'll go with domestic goddess
do u rly love her? a lot?
men cheat more than women
save money on flowers
i wanna go to the us, what do i need?
fix the problem or leave if you are so unhappy
looks are decieving, he may be a shitty boyfriend
she may think that looks stupid. to me, blue looks better.
you can make a citizen's arrest.
having a huge package doesn't mean you're good at doing it!
yes, it looks so hot on almost any woman!
dudes can't keep secrets worth af
depends on the dude, i guess
people were asking me why i was in such a hurry
neither of them respect ur feelings girl
i see him in psr every week but i can't gather up the gumption to talk to the guy
i dont find guys i like
i like men that shave legs
is it gay? ir curiosity
i say they do
its a mistake u cant fix
i lost my v card when i was 16 in a park! lol
they've never met in real life... but she says they're in love!!!
ask if he wants to dance w/ you!
live your life to the fullest and have faith!!!
idk if you fell over, but i'd like to have sex w/ you!
he knows you're into him so just ask him out
get over your fear and tell him
why the f would i drive 5 hours to spend time with somoene unless i really liked her?
aint she got friends to talk on the phone with her?
it's good to play sports with other guys.
when you fall in love everything feels wonderful and you can't stop thinking about your bae.
i can't imagine a life without my hubby.
it's easy to hurt those we love most.
go for it if you both feel that way when you're grown.
chicks want to hear the truth so tell her. good luck with that!
you fight all the time, do you want to spend your life doing that.
when i call you a man take that with a grain of salt.
i like small cups of a and b.
the hot girls are by the hideous men.
i want someone younger then me by 10 years, why the hell would i want someone older?
i am with them and it happened to me.
tell the truth about your feelings for her.
you should show her your naked baby pictures.
why is marriage important to the gay community?
we had sex on the hood of my car while it drizzled around us.
why do guys gotta grow up if girls don't expect them to?
you gotta do this a few times.
making love is like a fantasy.
rite now i think hes mad, and doesnt wanna be with u.
lemme know if youve got the answer plz!
red is a love color, nblack is a death color, etc.
i like fat ones, otherwise i feel like im missing out!
ask someone if you dont kno the answer.
he'll try to make it up, you'll like it.
if he's picking on you he likes ya!
i've been liking this girl since 9th grade.
she looking at u?
didnt know life could be such a blessing!!
got such a crush on this dude but dunno how he feels about me...
go with the best thing for you two.
look at like this, you got a real number not fake :)
i don't think you fool around.
they should get married if they can't keep their hands off each other.
seems like she's calling him all the time.
might as well keep on keeping on
how many loveless relationships have you been in?
is it right to break up with him cause of his mom
make a move and if she doesnt, give her space
they got married fast! 6months fast!
ask about them and they make tell you, so just be yourself.
show her your skills man.
you look like a freak.
i give props to that culture, because they really have it down pat.
you'll never know for sure unless you ask.
i'd love to now what you think, thanks.
don't worry about it or over think it.
what you think the worst could be?
i don't even know what to do cus i can't stand when the girl is like that, so like what do i do now?
find somebody else somebody down that don't hate you all the time.
dont be a dick
girls are way more discreet than guys
some guys just can't dance
these youngins r dumb.
you got a kid. r u hitched?
depends did ya trust him b4
fat and ugly guys can't b picky.
people choose marriage 4 a reason.
it’s not worth arguing with you all the time
good luck asking your cell mate that question
do i like you?
you kissed what??
some women are bi curious like me.
20 to 32, just not younger than you.
its easy. treat them nicely
after this you can make a decision
pickup lines are emabrrassing. be yourself. girls like that.
he cheated, so i can lift my husband
look on the bright side
is your goal to just hang out
in my opinion he would make a good valentine
with so many temptations i am not sure i can do it.
it takes what? a yr to feel comfy in relationshipz?
i u ready, then cool
hello yea i'm tryna meet chicks.
it is what it is.
you need to have safety precautions when you friend total strangers on the net.
can you picture having kids with that guy?
if he isn't interested in you, it's his loss, and why date a fool anyway?
you usually learn the best lessons when you go for it, and make mistakes.
you did marry him for love i hope.
whatever the lady wants she gets. so ask her?
at least i have someone who will be there for me right at home.
relax and get a massage and just let it all go.
where should i even start here.
depends, are you hot with a gr8 body???
wait.. you mean yr avatar?
spend all day together then give him a foot massage;)
he'll call if he cares
she thinks yr desperate cuz of the way you act
there is a idfference between fucking and making love
i haev four kids. being a homremaker is harder than my actual job
u dont gotta stay together even if u got a kid
are u a country girl?? ior are u from the city
getting married and having kids can wait. studying cant
i've never been.
you wanna be in a relationship with the same guy?
can you have sex with pamela anderson often?
don't make her hate you just to get your point across
this is too close to home, my moms has cancer too.
i luv to put my hands thru curlee hair
i mean u 2 together
just be patient and the rite girl will find u
i want my wife to grow 2
he seems shy, so you outta make the first move.
the doc was shocked too!
if you have a threesome, you'll probably get the rough sex you're looking for.
let's practice our kissing! where is your house?
you may think it's no, but it's def yes!
dont rage on me but maybe, as your name is freakgirl on here but if you show a pic, maybe not.
that's for boys to do - not men.
if u wanted u could ask them out and see.
and that did happen 2x to me.
don't make up some need in yur head to go out with that dude.
if he was the right guy, you wouldn't need to ask.
hope this streak never ends~
girls just want guys to be straight with their feelings.
nothin' like sex to bring out the passion in a woman
chicks like to be impressed so keep on impressing her
getting close and kissing me softly on me forehead.
that ain’t me but i know peeps like that.
she only worries about herself, nope that shouldn’t happen the first time.
depends on how hard you’re falling for this bro!
i just want to thank you ahead of time for the encouragement.
i just don't know why they want to get married so bad.
we like to be pursued, but with a light touch.
i ended up marrying him, but i wonder if you know why, other than love.
i think theme parks and museums are both fun places to visit.
i need to kno if im in love with this person or not.
do you like manicures or fake nails??
plan what u want, and dont worry about what everyone else wants.
but now we do all sorts of things together, and i dont know what to do.
i dont know what ur saring.
he tole me he still likes me, but his actions sure dont show it
ur perfume turns me on
practice unwraping starbursts with your tongue, women love it!
i don't think most men care but it depends on the guy.
its got nothing to do w/ being vulnerable or young or submissive...
don't get married so early in your relationship...
your not a good person if you plan on cheating on your wife!!
be the best you that you can be and see if he likes it.
hes the only one for you.
don't be a homewrecker. he's taken.
tell her that it's bs she makes you daily check in!
neighbor asked me out when i moved in
most teen guys prefer teen gals who like hooking up...
he played a good game of b-ball.
don't sweat it!
do u love fighting or what?
if he started liking u over her he prob would have ended it with her to be with u
important thing is to not try to get revenge on people who wronged u
a guy willing to move 21hrs and 1400mi for me
have you gone to the doctor yet?
she's not annoying but she was totally thin.
get a god dang life and leave me along.
that's like eating too much chocolate and saying you gained too much.
i was there and he was there.
no ball and chain, then do it!
these sorts of guys turn into wife beaters if you don’t give them what they want....
so do you think he’s cute or not?
well if you’re certain then tell the parentals that you haven’t yet.
a lot of people are going to tell you no..
does he feel the same about you?
some guys don't use that word unless they mean it.
tell him how you feel if you think he likes you.
i think everyone should keep their own name
boys come and go but friends are forever!!!
try and imagine that it was love <3
i think you'll be ready even if your relationship survives the 4 seasons...
okay, well right now some guys like that kind of women and other don't
if you want kids, be a house mom.
young boys and older women, yes or no?
he wanted to keep going.
you gotta stay true to your husband, be faithful.
u cant use another word for love
self image is important
im a girl and i say such things
girls can be perverted too
yeah i like flowers but they die too quick :p
theres some films i havent seen
she's super sweet, exactly what yr after!
use your brain and not whats in yr pants, she might not love you
don't take this the wrong way, but i've never heard of a guy with a name that girly.
i'm not gonna waste my time returning his call.
i wasn't really feeling any of the ladies in my list, so i settled for my neighbor's wifey.
openness and honesty are the core of any marriage.
just ignore what anyone else suggests.
how do i impress her?
a rose says i love you
dont worry, it's weird, not bad
figure out what works for both of you.
she’s enough of a woman but she ain’t classy like us.
yep, especially after she got really sick....
bc you know, search for your love but be careful.
can’t help you anymore unless you give me mor info.
there’s no way to be good or bad at kissing.
just think it out
having fun with dudes is okay
think about some of the things you like doing and do it to them, like using you're tongue
they were my friend before they were my spouse. that makes it great.
that's probably more of a trust issue
i need help understanding this.
move on, there are plenty of fish in the sea.
he probably wasn't into it either.
when you can, make it yourself.
u do anything else than work & fix stuff?
i let her know that i really luv her.
the uppers think the frosh gals are easy game. thats messed up!
should i really just kiss'em?
it should be in the deleted stuff if you take a peek.
i hope you find a cute girl
thats a bad idea, its not for that purpose
its a long ass list
brokeback mountain, youd like it even if youre a guy
if its not dependent on sex, thats fine
i'll prolly tell her soon... she's my bff, y'know? any help would be appreciated
yah, but it's bad luck to see the bride before the ceremony, y'know?
hold on and godspeed!
uh, just a small family thing at my house
if you're concerned about the performance, don't go through with it
i'm married now
it depends on age and upbringing
you need to choose your kid's last name
kid's life is hard without a dad
baldies look like kids, it's ugly
give it a chance, you only risk making it more difficult to be friends.
the last games score was...?
choose the guy you're with, or your ex.
best and easiest is fly or drive to vegas and get hitched.
yes i just wanna get to know u
size c or d at the most but the rest new much
lie to them and then just keep lying!
it’s double the pleasure since they haven’t performed before
my wife doesn’t like wearing those brands
we have no idea what u look like
opposites attract, we can always find a life partner if we look hard enough
lol, this is def better than my everyday life
eh, you went with your ex there, don't go there with your new date, too
talk to your bff and find out if it's all good
weird, but it worked for me in about 3 to 5 days or so
it annoys me when you get teased by him about everything!!
no, i'm still unmarried.
a lot of dudes like big chicks, mostly black guys
i luv writing poems for the ladies...u done this for your lady friends b4?
i told her im into her and she didnt want to mess up our friendship
shouldnt matter. you like him then say
do they throw shade when youre together?
i like those. and since im a guy, i dont need to have a adate
dont get married if u feel leike that
it depends if they are in vain
move on and date someone who likes u
get to know her and then ask the other out
i asked if he blowed me off
nasty old guys like young asians
do what you want!
hmm, tell him you just wanna keep this casual...
you should be happy unless he isn't treating you well?
thats a hard situation and there aren't any easy answers!
they have been hard but good years.
we seen each other eberyday for like 4 or 5 years!
if i am the guy you want then be wit me!
live a little and flirt!
stay with what u feel inside.
good luck
is it bad if i havent kissed her since we started dating 8 months
its her choice
they look better than other countries
itll be okay the next day
ask her out for dinner and a movie.
some guys don't think about it they just do it.
speak english please. i can't understand you.
sorry i don't feel that way.
just remember that a bird can't fly with only one wing
yeah i think about this a lot
if you're just whatever about it you'll never find anyone to date
there's this girl that i met and i'm wondering if she likes me
dont just wait around for the call
quit your bitching, nobody cares if you're gay
lots of women in their early 20s date men that are in their late 20s, and in turn some men of their age date younger women
break up with him if he cant get it together
it's possible he loves you and will end up letting his dad down.
stay strong! never apologize when you haven't even made a mistake
fix it before you regret it.... time is a-wasting.
this chick thinks bad boys are way over-rated.
i wanna hear what a black chick would say about this.
help me beat her in this debate.
almost all of those guys are near your age.
when will people realize and notice shit.
i'm not sure what i should do.
you go and get wasted at the bar.
i acted like that with my new lover
if you have to ask, forget about it.
don't wait for him to see you're the one that's good.
ugh, still stuck w/ this even though getting divorced
you got this - have fun.
your bae will just think your being an ass.
you can't fix what's going on w/ her parents, but maybe what's going on with friends? why?
right now i wouldn't marry any girl who does'nt want to change her last name for me, but thats just how i feel.
why don't you try dating chicks if you can't stand dating guys.
my dirty ex cheated on me after 3 full years
you will know soon enough. after six month see what happens.
the one i thought was good goes a little something like this.
not all dudes dumb chicks
its always tons of stuff to do over there
is it ight to smooch on the 1st date?
i got a homegirl i'm close with
they in lust *lol
when he does, tell him it was a mistake tp breaup
my friend says im too nice and i should say no
there is always an exception
not all men, but some o
if u do that, u keep ur last name
just walk up, introduce yourself, and ask if she's available.
i was all hot and bothered, but i got out of there quick.
big girls can still be total cuties.
not everybody here is a student
unwrap starburst and tie cherry stems with your tongue for practice
he will think he is going to marry you if you talk to him for another week
vote for me in best answer and ill pay for you
look in public, youll feel more comfortable
just flirt with him and see what happens
also it takes the pressure off me to ask somebody
come on! go out with me plz!!
she's not gonna forget that i messed up.
how do i make it seem i want more than sex?
i'm a guy i know about this stuff.
dont worry. ur 13
go fon a trail with a friend
it u love each other, itll work out
eye contact is improtant
i can lift him no problem
he needs to regain your trust and start completely over again
i get it. i had the same ex in 2, 4 and 8 grade
are you sure you want to ask her out?
i hope u get the info soon
play truth or dare together
wait till uno for sure. then decide
thats dumb. u just need a theory class
quit if u eat something like that
i keep thinking about fucking her
u will only know if u ask him directly
jamie will ask out rubi
its still happening cause neither has courage to end it
maybe they just dig learning about that stuff.
he's dribbling the ball, he shoots annnnnnd score, 2 points for the champion.
do dudes really want big girls over other types?
i know he loves you like you like you love him, but no one knows the future.
if he respects you, he will understand what u need.
we have our own sins started.
his answer was good enought for me.
love him sure, but let him go.
smart chicks are sexy!
it' nasty having to take her too.
my sis closes her eyes b4 she kisses.
in a roundabout i met bf
he not gettin married this month
should i jus let it go or nah
why u bringing everything up bout me
it sounds like you guys are already married
first, why didnt they end the relationship?
give him some space he may call you back
tell more people
one step at a time. think about how he lost something good.
ask harold when you're gonna go to dinner.
not if you have to ask.
you can still come home or call friends and family but you gotta go to school.
i will never get laid again
let him come over and do the talking
some people don do that because of church
you should feel good.
people only choose to do what they feel comfortable doing.
think about it and, and decide if you can trust him!
i wasn't saying "do you think women are sexy and beautiful."
are they going to be violent, qask them
you enjoy selling your self to much
see if he will go out of his way
it has a deffention of being able to go out of your way for another.
they dont kow antyhing about you, how would they know
who cares what they think.
if you could pick 4 traits for your girl what would they be?
we like guys who think of us.
i feel excited but weird.
just stay cool! it can help to be a littl hard to get
do you see the way that girl walks?
he totally shouldn't care if ya'll are at a dance together
chicks like confident dudes, yeah?
ask her out again after class is over, dude
you need to get into counseling asap
i'm pretty sure i still got lovey feelings for him, tho
that's fine, tho. i'm generous, if you get my meaning
if you wanna get something you're stuck with, then go for it.
you've only met the guys with one thing on their mind.
i'm not saying you have to stop getting your freak on till then.
if he doesn't feel like dancing, don't push it.
i'm a dude, so lemme tell you what i've learned.
i don't even know why my gf won't tell me she loves me to my face.
i have no idea if she really means it or not.
help!! i don't know to get to know her.
hubby and me both love my long black hair.
people make fast decision in this day and age.
maybe they're trying too hard to be something they can't?
naww you can't do that because i've been married to a piece of trash.
u need to keep away from ur guy friend.
i'm trying to find a chick to spend time with me.
it's been the best thing for me at least.
i met this guy once, in a rainstorm it was very romantic.
you will get more money if you work for me.
will it ever be the same after that?
it could be, just choose an answer and tell why.
talk to me in 4yrs.
having brown hair rocks!
if you need a hubby present sports or car stuff is what i’d do.
you need to find whats right for you.
he cheated on me, its one of the worst things he could do and i cant forgive him.
can you imagine yourself in bed with him at night.
it hurt so much and i bled.
you can interpret that so many ways.
10 years apart is just a good thing
um, you gotta do more than make eyee contact!!!!
u want all your friends 4eva?
hate him 4 what he did
i know what i'm looking for.
it happened in the middle of the river while everyone watched. it was pretty funny!
show em your boobs if ya know you hot
it's normal with a guy
malaysia air ads on tv are bae i love them
go out and get crunk because you not with him/her
yeah i love giving pleasure more than i like to recieve it
omg is it ok to still have feelings for him after 6 fkin months?
when you feel it coming on then start the foreplay again
doesnt matter, guys will think youre hot anyway
yeah its a fucking challenge...
you can ask any woman passing by in thailand but never do it here haha
its important and around 30 to 45 mins
my problems is i love him
its buy 1 take 1
i didn't know pakistan's conservative.
let's wrest;e and be buds!
i barely see him in school, but i've seen him going to my bro's b-ball games.
u didn't tell us....where do y'all live?
just say why you like.
they're basically saying they don't like you.
break ups happen eventually.
i fell in love with a guy when i worked there.
i will go and see, more than likely.
don't delay, just get started and get it done.
different strokes for different folks, but some guys like fat women no one would fight them over.
i just shot that comment from the hip and didn't think he would remember.
girls don't like guys who are all wrapped-up in themselves.
if you look they are rigth there.
any one cv or dvd cause both will work.
you guys work really hard to get shit right!
if she likes you, she will call you.
when were apart youre all i think about bc i care about you.
should i give him another chance?
if you feel like you dont love them anymore, dont ignore it.
daniel hasn't read a manga book in his life.
try to use some of these, only if they actually apply though.
the same thing happened to me 2
did she just want to go out with other people?
pick the 1 that u like the best
you gotta get yourself ready to let her go...
sometimes i talk about my problems too early in a relationship.. maybe i told him too much
it is probably common.. but i'd just keep going...
just get rid of him - you'll be better off!
pay attention to your spouse
if he gets em first then the popcorn is all yours
okay, so it's a rebound relationship, so what?
my girlfriend is a zealot like no other, but you know what? i love her more cause of it
one day you will find a mann who is truly in luv wit u :*)
keep your head up.
green or blue cool
goes either way
i want a girl who is nice and not stupid.
at least it's not as bad as bella.
it's not 90%, or 70%, it's 65%.
what good would it bring?
i don't know what she wants.
my best friend hates the person i'm with and hopes we break up, but it's not going to happen.
we hang out now and again.
you let atleast a thousand out.
my friends are so obviously hormonal.
happy womb liberation day!!!!!
because women use their brains!
i think you need to compliment her, find out her name and just be smooth as butter and a normal person.
how much time will go by till she stops caring
girls dont like it. they think men who smoke are filthy cause they are dieing
i only act normal around guys i dont like. you know
the older man timing was off
bring them both on a date
im a maid of honor. it ust be perfect
my dude snores so i can never sleep!
they shouldnt hang out if they can;t get along. who gives a shoot?
if you dont make it known you want her forever, it will work out better that way.
let he rknow to only call if it's important.
i gotta stop cuz im about to relieve myself for real.
after 3 days... with me you're a distant memory.
did you just feel like saying that?
i agree with the other guy, now lets stop before anyone gets hurt.
no one likes to be kept on a string and toyed with like a yo-yo.
i want that done 2 me
impress her with attention and love
men have dicks. women have clits
ur love for ur wife should be limitless
i don't want a high maintenance chick,just a trustworthy one
i like the straight versions of that product
its a reason why she likes him
tru friend can be trusted above all else!
sounds odd, idk, i'll get with my friend later at his loi will, you are a cker.
if you're of average size, breast size shouldn't be a big deal.
i a man, and men have feelings too!
call them and ask to get some help. have a good day!
i like smart, nice sexy women.
she saved my butt by answering first.
if you send a nude you get laid.
where are you finding all of the filipina chicks?
go and ask him if he wants to go and do something.. maybe lunch or a movie.
i haven't bc i like normal-looking guys!!!
someone was really awful to me because i was still dating...
i love him but i also wanna move on...
yeah ask for permission and see how quickly she gets violent with you!!!!
guys think they are soo special and that only some girls are good enough for them!!
sometimes i want sex
i've gotten that a few times
if sounds like u control the relationship
wait for someone who likes u and treats u well
dont go there. it seems weird
gotta look nice
he'll come back if he really likes you, dont worry
my crush is mad at me
you dig asian food?
my cousin met up with some perv she met online who said he was a hot teen
if u gotta ask u aint in love
dont listen to what men say watch how they act.
dont let no man change u, do you
i still love him and don't know what to do.
just talk it over with your hubby.
all u have to do if bat your eyes at him. that's it. done deal.
just go ahead and tell her and live happily ever after.
asking that really killed the moment....you ever think of trying something enjoyable together??
also kissing and seeing if you’re good at it.
jules sac is hilarious and crude too.
see my man?!
i think when a man can’t get over himself it’s pretty unattractive.
i'm just like ur wife so i know!
if u ask others, i don't think ur ready to
rip your shirt off and yell like tarzan;)
if you don't love ur husband, move on and make room for another 1.
give her an honest compliment
oo i am also into a guy in 6th grade!
they feel insecure when their around guys who aren't as educated
maybe we can go on a date and fall in love!
if she tells them, ill be kicked out cause its pakistan and not the us
my friend is dating someone online
i want to cuddle a fat girl
i think the bomb is better
we hung out with bob's dad from his side of our family.
things that take forever to move.
be friends first and then let the relationship go natural.
for the three years of my relationship i was cheated on.
go at him because he likes another girl?
don't let them know until your already in bed together.
that's not a big deal in america.
always listen to what people say. don't act to full of yourself, but be confident.
whatever happens happens
yep, i dated someone just like that.
i wish i listened to my friends advice
if hes throwing a mood, ignore him
do what makes you happy
we tried to move it but didn't work
if you don't ask someone else probably will.
my twin won't listen to me or talk to me.
girls are polite, she'll answer.
there was a reason you married him.
just ask him if he wants to see a movie... how hard is that?
women dont always find men their age very attractive
doesnt matter, we're just friends anyway
you should take some self defense classes
that's what it's like, amirite?
how smashed is this chick
you oughta get to know em both before datin either of em.
girl he crushin on u hard!!!
you can join a chat room thats got video 2.
good times man, good times.
if u cheat, he gonna cheat...
white women are appropriating men in general.
it would make me crazy if she called 5 times a day.
you're probably the only one he's having sex with.
tell them to leave.
how old r u
they cant control the lives of others
let him go if u like him
someone i can just be me around.
the rest is cakkkkeeeeee!
say i love you and if they say it back you know its real.
just ended a 3yr relationship with my baby daddy.
wishing you luck searching for your one!
i love him still after all this time.
did he say anything? he knows you care.
people think different about who is attractive.
my other half is forgiving.
he tryna be fab with u?
i guess hypothetically yo would date me if i was single.lol
males and females be tripping
she a user so run
stay away from the hit that will fuck u up
you'd be amazed at the kind of people that are drawn to that guy
don't do it until you get to 25 yrs old, don't worry, you'll still be appealing then
if you're sure about that, then do it that way
do dudes even know what they want from a relationship at all?
ur gonna have bad times if ya need ur ex emotionally.
if are ok with it, go with it.
don't forget, till death do you part.
ain't nothing wrong with her asking for your digits.
if the answer is yes, what's with these girls saying flowers don't last?
don't be talking about her looks.
asking her that shouldn't bother her if you guys are in a serious relationship
i say maui or the bahamas...
the problem is whether your gonna ask her out at work or not
the way he asked me out was so nice!!!
um, youre setting up a double-standard.
i can't give you a wife-based view, but i can give you my view, which is hopefully as good.
you have every right to feel angry and sad.
he got to his station and hopped off the train
start from the beginning and work down to 20 years in the future...
say no! no fear!
let it be, she has had enough no matter what she say
kiss your job goodbye if you are wrong!
try getting down at tha club!
i missed out on a lot of good stuff by keepin my head in the clouds
how can i make him shove off?
when you're 18-20 you more likely to just say crap and not mean it
why the hell did he shave his legs???
be nice, look em in the eyes and smile
why does everyone else thinkg about this
guys, what size girls do you like
she doesnt want you to like her only for her body
gl is all i can say
there was only one girl i truly lvoed
if yes, go get em
if u want her to be a friend, ud like a deeper relationship more
u gonna hurt ppl u love with them secrets
be your self and don't be simpin cause thats what chicks like
forget what the haters got to say
dudes that say they will, aint being honest
his brothers better, forget him!
dead be likes some box-full uh candy co'n.'s coo', bro. it gives ya' cavities.
i would not wants' some pair dat big
oders likes t'believe due t'de way society dictates it. ah' recon' we should rebel against society and appreciate curvia' honky chicks.
dat only makes ha' easia' t'gotss' sexual intercourse wid.
call him if ya' feel dat level uh attracshun t'him.'s coo', bro.
its cause you dont have decision making power
its your life. do what u want
the older you fet the better you feel
fyi, i dont like a woman who eats romantic dinner at home
i just do this for the points, y'know?
you gotta take the risk, y'know
work on your relationship with him, just don't let him isolate you at the house
dude idc what you do, don't tell him yet!
it's not smart to date people you meet at work
go for a movie if u both want to
it happens after threeplay and before fiveplay
buy a sex toy that ud both like
you gotta deal with every mans ego.
udaman is right.
i wanna win him over instead of pushing him away because i like him that much.
i dont think of him but i do dream of him
not until he finds someone new
date some new ppl
dont do something ull regret
the safest way to date online is chat through e-mail and over the phone
i finished up and it was a trip, man
there's lots of cheap ideas to run across, just pick what you're interested in and get w ith it
maybe there's plenty of guys that would think the world of you, you're just missing them
keep looking, you'll find the right chick eventually!
you know you belong together if you can fart around each other.
i hope i see some of it shortly.
just go up and start talking to her.
i dont know ur age, would would be nice
yes. it is not a good habit
society has no place for ppl like this
u mean'seems more slutty'
thats a trick question
its like saying what gonna stop me after i already did it
the right date can save lotta cash
thats all i gotta say
why cant guys just say love
your girlfriend should just accept that if she loves you
then he asked if he could come with me
so many guys just want sex!
a spasm in the back is what usually causes it.
they should take our last names i think.
you pick a guy over your friend.
you'll know if he likes you.
i like that they go for the challenge.
make her media content
i wanna be happy
nah don't try to hit
when i love its hella embarrassing
it'll be worth it when u ready
u too good for em
so is he checkin for me orrrr...?
men gotta take the first step in the rship imo!
i woulda kept my last name if i could damit!
take out the bad and let it go yo!
ask him how he's doing sometimes.
try doing new things to meet people.
i'm not over my ex yet but now he likes my cousin...i'm furious.
it ended up being a good idea.
celebrate v day with lolz, presents and fun!!!
nope other than their looks.
there was never a choice 2 begin with yo.
i think they both like me tho!!
they like them small girls
remember to pick the best answer n vote!
we were married in dec 2005, been together for 4 years!
must visits are navy pier n museums. lots of good hotels n restaurants too.
one of them will cheat, in my experience
forget about it, i dont have much to work with either
mom books from pat@alanatvl.com
its been over 6 months and i cant get over this
relocating to mass is what she needed...
not a biggie but one handful's good.
some chicks dig gifts that last.
she thought she was happier than she really was, but at least she is strong and loving...
you like 6th graders? wow! you must be young!
surfacey stuff like size, shape and looks shouldn't even matter.
you're wondering what they think about gay marriage and relationships?
i think so too, just kiss him and you'll get a response!
he gave me his cel so i could add my number to it.
if u want to have a good time; check out local night clubs, restaurants & gyms,etc
id say that some times it works, but no to pften. hope this helps
if ur ever in fl, drop me a line
ask her out
im sorry, idk.i wish u both luck
hi, can i visit your country?
find a hot girl and make her jealous.
don’t ask if you can’t accept the answer
i am completely stuck and need help because she knows i care so much about him.
finally, does he always stare at you?
maybe try some foreplay to take it slow :)
usually girls with light skin look more pale when they get black hair
there was no way i would lose to her.
telling her she's fat is a serious no no.
you wanna hear this awesomely bad joke i got?
if you weren't playing the guilt trip card, you know it would happen.
seems like he has to much fun while your gone.
of course anyone would too!
some couples will never be that close with each other.
clearly dudes aren’t any better.
no second date i went on wit him
perhaps since you are thuh most attractive young lady they have ever encountered
you found them and need to stick with them for love.
if he's good enough for you, then you won't have to.
talk about kissing when you're older.
order it online, the stork will work its magic
the older you get the harder it becomes.
just move forward and get a new person.
what is their age?
u just gotta smile now
ima be real, u gotta stop talking with and thinking about him!
the chicks that complain about not getting flowers aint grateful
i'm loving coz thats why i'm single
the chicks that are cute or nice or whateva
dont know, cant say i'm really into girls.
its time to ditch your cousin and boyfriend completely.
i dont remember ever giving a xmas pressent to a girl except if i liked her.
whose exactly gonna know whether rural chicks feel sexier?
we met at a carnival.
my husband likes me for me.
she isn't a liar.
if it doesn't work then move on.
figure out what kind of flowers you like.
if he doesnt say no, who else really matters?
youre too good for that guy.
she let me work and watch cartoons
lime green is a summer wedding color
can i do anything
right relatiinships happen on their onw
unless u tryna prove something, looks aint everything
yo just tell me the truth i can take the truth...
eat breakfast first then take a walk.
when i accidentally deleted my friend last time, he was so pissed.
omg do not have sex.
when you break the news, do it nicely.
u 2 need to kiss when your ready
just keep asking her questions, then u don't have to even talk.
im guessing she loves u because u r a good person.
she calls, text her back
no dont do it, its not good, youre wasting your time and health
ask someone you like to be your valentine
tell her you love and miss her
you just gotta keep asking until it gets done.
some just don't have what it takes, but others do.
there's no way he's gonna say no.
that's a decent shot of george clooney you got there.
my partner wants me to look different
those are cocky replies... i am a lot better-looking!
um, bad teeth, awful breath, and rly bad bo.
nothing u say will make it better
everyone would be happier if men know what females wanted!
who want to blow a guy?
i dont wanna marry u
im a guy so i dont gotta pay
he can wear my pants if he asks
is it a rebound relationship for both of you?
good luck in your search for a new love.
why do people seem to want someone they can not have, and know they should not want?
do you like to argue and fight?
if that is your decision, then that is what you should do.
my ex of three years cheated on me.
work at it, but do not allow him to keep you locked up at home.
other than those two things, ask him once in awhile.
men get bored and tired before women do.
she is really tough and loving and above all...really was not as happy as she appeared to be.
it is one way of stating i do not like you!
king did have a song about this=only your mother loves you (and find might be jiving too).
he loves you too, lady...time will tell.
he wants me to change how i look.
i know i have someone to come home to.
i do not know if you fell down, but i want to have sex.
do you want to keep all of your friends forever?
acting that way does not make you a slut.
i enjoy going to a club and dancing.
don't go anywhere with you new date that you went with your ex.
going there is great fun, and there are plenty of things to do.
it will all depend on when you are ready.
stay very far away from this man.
you should be prepared because if it happened once it could happen again.
i am looking for the girl who wants to spend time with me.
at least not until he finds another girlfriend.
my wife says we don't wear things like that.
if you are uncertain, you should break up and open yourself to seeing other people.
why do same-sex couples want to be married?
don't say sorry to him unless you've actually made a mistake.
do you have to rush this decision?
they both disrespect your feelings.
no, seriously. think about how many arrogant women are out there.
she is frightened about asking him on a date.
get a grip! how can you love someone, with whom you cannot even communicate?
i would ask you on a date, but i live in oregon, and i have no idea where you live.
they have never performed before, and it doubles the pleasure!
i will go and see one.
i am happy that i have brown hair.
if you email me, i can tell you the answer.
it is a challange.
i will help you.
do not let them know in advance but rather allow them to discover once you are in bed together.
i should have kept my last name.
i rarely see him in school but i have seen him attending my brother's basketball games.
he is a womanizer and has been telling that to some young woman.
break up with him. there are plenty of fish in the sea.
i know, because i am like your wife.
when she calls, you should text her back.
no way, i am only 5'4" and he is 6'2".
you do not know the first rule, trust no one.
we've attempted to end the relationship on several occasions however we never succeed.
oh, and a portion due to them being slender and slim and these days young women suffering anorexia are sexually exciting.
given that you possess male genitalia, it isn't an issue. you are simply required to insert your engorged member into her vagina.
in such a circumstance, enroll in some self-defense courses.
i just escaped a three-year romance with the father of my newborn.
want to hear a bad joke?
i have been working for years.
women are coomplicated.
we like a soft approach with a little chasing.
you would be suprised at the type of people that are interested in them.
it is very enjoyable, especially when you meet each other after exchanging text messages for a few months.
i am in new york city. i will help you if you are nearby.
it sounds strange but it worked in about three to five days for me.
do not worry, i do not have much to work with either.
why does their opinion matter? if they do not get along, then do not spend time together.
should he behave as such, you are in possession of a quality male!
if he has affection for you, you will be aware!
i imagine it's common, however, i'd simply proceed.
the remainder is simple from this point forward!
i am fond of all gentlemen with a sense of humor.
young lady, you are the singular person capable of rendering this decision.
what's the reason for posing the query?
proceed to inform all simply due your belief that it is correct to do so.
ten years' separation is simply appealing.
after that if he still does not like you, then you need to move on.
even though i see him each week in psr i can not find the courage to talk to him.
because they feel less secure with men who are less educated.
one reason is that if it does not work out you could lose your job.
also i pray that it does not ever pass.
only the ones that are not worth your time.
smaller of course, and it is all about how they look.
you guys do not have any reason to hate one another.
if you do not. you will always wonder.
people choose not to because of their religion, while others do not.
give it a chance, because if you break up with them it would be harder to be simply friends.
best of luck to you.
men who were not ready to commit.
it is a big day in both of your lives, it should not be done quickly or without thought.
i am 55-years-old and still live at home with my mother. what is wrong with that?
i want one man willing to move 21 hours and 1,400 miles away to be with me.
i must not be unattractive enough, then.
that is alright. i am a giver.
well, it depends on the woman. what does she want?
remember: it takes two, and not one.
he would have dumped her for you, if he really preferred you over her.
hang around until the bar closes, or visit a prison.
please do not miss out on this one!
women do not like men who are cocky.
stick with what is inside of you.
it happenned to me, twice.
maybe you are too young.
actions are better then words.
there is nothing in the world like a big-boned woman!
do not sell yourself, even if he is rich.
i am a gay male, aged thirty, and i just moved to sacramento, ca.
the people who are around you now should like you no matter what, especially your friends!
because they like small breasts and vaginas.
wait till you are older and then if you both still feel the same you can go for it.
yes, i am not one of those people but i know there are many of them around.
no, it is not if you have to ask.
and you want to give oral sex to another man?
it is because they are girls and not as sophisticated as we are.
does this mean that he is attracted to me?
do not worry about him. just concentrate on school; learn and then worry about your boyfriend.
i know, because i dated one.
look at the way that she walks.
the answer is no, i least i hope not.
hello, i am looking forward to visiting your country.
should i give him another chance, overtime?
is he the same man that you wanted to be in a relationship with?
i traveled there and he was present.
that's the name i applied to it. for what reason, though?
by doing so, you're still able to retain your surname.
you two individuals toil rigorously to achieve accuracy!
i've previously communicated my affection to her and she expressed her concern about damaging our relationship as friends.
you can join a community that has live and webcam chat.
show her your naked baby photos.
it is very important to last at least 30 to 45 minutes.
however, i am not telling you to be celibate until that time!
it is okay to jump on him if he is flirting with her.
i adore curly hair as i favor running my fingers through it.
i desire my wife to grow as well.
well, that is simply the manner it is done, i suppose.
one female, michelle, who most likely would not being mentioned, stated that she did not believe in it.
i can simply ignore him and forget about him similarly to the previous night's garbage.
he was busy after that time.
i don't know what to do about it, she knows i care about him so much.
if you eat something similar to that, then you should quit.
it could be that you need to use the bathroom, or had a dream about it.
if he wanted to wear my pants, all he would have to do is ask.
if you were friends before and have stronger feeling now, then it should be okay.
i want to try again.
figure out what kind of flower arrangements you would like.
deceive and mislead and then fabricate some more.
first, wait until you find that out for sure and then go from there.
he should not care if the two of you were at a dance.
trust him and do not bring it up again.
honestly, most women are waiting for the man to tell her how he truly feels.
of course i would love to meet women.
i actually ponder this one every once in awhile.
i met a man in a rainstorm, it was very romantic.
some men prefer women like that, and some do not.
it comes after three play and before five play.
when i fall in love, i feel stupid.
if you have to ask, then you are not in love.
if you start to feel it coming on, then resume the foreplay.
i do not understand. someone, please give me the answer.
i saved a good five-to-six-hundred dollars doing my own flowers, and it was no hassle at all.
he and i just got a divorce!
however, you ought to ask a girl regarding the symptoms, since i am a boy.
be authentic and demonstrate some machismo. that is what women, or at least most women, like. however, foremost is being authentic.
listen to your intuition. it is never wrong.
they harass you throughout the day.
notice whether he call, emails or even cares.
you could provide a civilian arrest answer.
usually that is caused by a spasm in the back.
by this time, you should love your wife for everything the two of you have endured.
good luck on your new adventure. i hope everything goes well!
you can start by saying i love you and wait to see if they say it back.
ask her on a date again and see what she says.
there is no way to make someone fall in love with you.
ask her questions, do not merely talk.
when you initially fall in love, you become biddy and oddly happy merely thinking of that person.
remember that there is more than one.
i believe they look better than many other nations.
we got married again!
all in all i do not think it matters.
i am definitely not driving five hours just to see her unless i really like her.
how often can you have sex with pam anderson?
i told her that i loved her and meant it.
what good did it bring?
i am a person that does not like to break the other persons heart.
give a rose and express your love.
i like someone with some weight because i feel cheated with a thin one.
remember that it is "till death do you part".
because we always find a life partner, therefore, we are attracted to the opposite side.
what in the world are you speaking of?
if you persist in speaking to him for another week, he may believe he is married to you.
women do not desire very much, just some acknowledgement and at times assistance.
at least, that is what it seems like to me.
do not be afraid to say, "no."
end things with him, there are always more fish in the sea.
to me it really does not matter. a hand full is quite enough for me.
choose the one that cherishes you the most.
you still released a thousand, at least.
you go get inebriated at a bar.
give it some time and thought.
you should not leave them, just teach them what to do to better satisfies you.
bembie got the answer correct.
the two of you should kiss when you are ready.
julesac is funny, yet callous.
if you are asking this, then you surely have already distanced yourself from her, yet remaining a friend.
do not forget ot vote for best answer.
it is just the way things are.
i know of another website that i go to.
are you starting to have feelings for this boy?
he had a controlling personality.
it depends on how interested one party is in the other.
you should attempt to get out and meet people.
usually there are multiple factors instead of just one.
if you truly like them.
do you men prefer a big woman or a smaller woman?
it is not worth it, if all you do is argue.
i went out with him for 4 years, it makes the situation worse.
you have to be patient and the right girl will come around.
do you not love your husband, because you have room for another man?
you can do more without commiting a sin if she is your wife.
she does want you to think she is attractive, but does not want that to be the only reason.
some says i want to have sex, and some days i do not want to.
they are more passionate when making love.
you may enjoy sex that much more if you play with both at the same time.
i left him because he was a bad man.
it may be due to the fact that you are the most beautiful woman they have ever seen.
it depends on if they are vain.
i want someone that likes me for me.
send a picture of yourself to me, and please be in contact.
stay away from this man.
the doctor was surprised as well.
exactly, especially when she became sick.
do not worry.
i can give you pointers.
if you feel that your love is fading, you have to do something.
i will not stay with a person i do not trust.
only once did i tell a girl that i was in love with her, and i meant it.
you married him and there was a reason.
tear off your shirt and scream like tarzan.
yes, girl beneath there, do not have sexual relations.
they are accepting of this in their culture.
always ride with a friend.
you did not give us very good information. do you all live in one house?
move on. what does it matter if he is attractive? appearance is not all-important.
most importantly, be genuine.
you are justified in feeling disappointed and angry.
i am soory, but i have never felt that way.
i do not like a woman who makes my life difficults.
you get the popcorn if he gets them first.
practice asking if you are performing well.
but if you are sure then first tell your parents if you have not done so already.
well, i met mine at a carnival.
that sounds like a rhetorical question.
well, i believe that everyone should keep his or her own name.
your first kiss should make you feel as if you are in heaven.
this seems like it is going to be problematic.
how can i make a woman happy?
don't try something that will hurt you.
you will always make money if you work hard.
don't just walk up and tell her how good she looks.
i do not think this is a good idea; you are not there for this purpose.
approach her, say hello, and ask if she is single.
i think he would make a wonderful valentine.
be prepared to let her go.
rather than simply waiting until you are acceptable.
ask if they are going to become violent.
get a massage, and take some time off from everything.
if you actually like this guy, make more of an effort to talk to him.
bring both of them out on a date.
it has happened to me, and now i am dating said person.
there are two points to making friends. 1)
so you might not be looking for the type of man who thinks the world of you.
it should be someone who does not hate you.
we tried moving on but it did not work.
when will pepole begin to realize this?
i would not call him back.
try not to spend time with him and find another man.
find a different attractive woman, she will become jealous.
in my opinion you are not a hoe.
red means love, black means death, etc.
if she likes him then she does not like you. break up with her, it is not his fault that she strays.
for me, any longer than three days and i may begin to forget you.
find a woman with talents who is also attractive.
there is no one whom you can trust more than a good friend.
start the day off with breakfast and then perhaps a nice walk.
then go pick them up, if she says yes, of course.
if yes, why do i hear some women say flowers are not going to last?
maybe it is interesting for them.
i wonder if it could ever be the same after that.
it is not as bad as it could have been; at least it is not bella.
is it possible that the answer is because some men are not truthful and boastful?
another option is that you could tell her and have a fairy tale romance.
finally a culture that has it right.
my twin will not talk or listen to me.
if you want to get something that you cannot get rid of, then go ahead.
i am not thinking about him, but i am having dreams about him.
if you are talking ten dollars, then i think it would be fine to get a computer game.
take a chance and go for it.
if he can not dance, take him to a place where they have slow dances.
i feel that a family life is beautiful.
i dislike them, but if you like them, it is ok.
you should never get married without a prenuptial agreement.
find a way to have a life, and do not waste mine.
she said that you are too good for her?
men will come and go, but friends are forever.
i may mean a lot of things.
yes, it is typical. their are many people who still are attracted to an individual they no longer see.
i'd enjoy seeing what a african american female has to say about this.
men are idiotic. no one comprehends why they do what they do.
if they presented you with their phone number, no need to wait.
because we're masters of the universe.
i am in love and i do not care who loves it.
whatever you do, do not try to have them both at once.
if you were truly interested in being with him, you would not be asking.
remember that being friends with someone online is ok, however, there are limits.
when my sister kisses someone, she closes her eyes.
i personally would not want to marry any woman who does not want to change her name.
a small party for the family.
women are degenerates. they merely hide it and behave that way in secret around other women.
and i am only in fifth grade.
but you should do what you want.
avoid doing that as it will not work.
if they do not do that, then it is time to leave.
he has everything i am looking for in a guy.
it is bad luck to see your bride at the wedding.
she is not a false witness.
be quiet and be whatever sexual orientation that you wish.
he had his nose pierced.
yes, i can lift him, he is only 185.
you will need a therapist for that.
there are some perverted guys that like young looking asian girls.
you should see a therapist.
he is giving you a poor excuse for acting in a way he did not before.
be strong, and hang in there.
he is too large, and i am weak.
it is unattractive if she is heavily intoxicated and becomes messy.
keep in touch by sending letters, emails, talking on the phone.
especially if you do not feel like it.
he dribbles, he shoots, and he scores two points.
giving it up for him to stick around is like selling your soul to the devil.
i cannot give you a wife-view, but hopefully mine is as good.
plus, if takes the pressure off of me to ask someone.
it depends on the woman. it is better if it is shaved.
ask the question using english terms. i am not able to understand you.
hello. i am a man but i will tell you a little.
i like him very much but i want to persuade him not reject him.
i really, really think a guy is attractive but don't know if he feels that way about me.
by the way, your avatar looks familiar.
we broke up over six months ago, and i cannot seem to move on.
maybe he thinks he will be turned down. i would just ask him.
thinking about that should help you in seeing whether or not you can trust him.
a photograph in the shape of a heart with you and her on your first date. that is special.
i am in college and he is my only source of income until i graduate.
it is not that simple. i acquired my first boyfriend in second grade, then again in fourth, and again in eighth.
i have been in a relationship with this woman for eight months and we have not kissed. is this bad?
some men do not like breasts at all.
does she want to see other people?
he has seen me everyday for about 4 or 5 years.
it was his stop, so he got off the train.
the absolute worst situation that could occur is that he states no. good luck with your opportunity.
i'm aware of exactly what i want in a relationship.
i would flirt, tease, then mail flowers and candies to myself. he'd ask me out eventually.
i dislike seeing my father unhappy.
i feel bad because i snore sometimes. don't most people snore when they sleep?
i have feelings for a person and need to know if i am in love.
if the two of you truly love each other, then you will work things out.
the relationship is still happening because neither of you have the courage to end things.
girls who are heavier can still be attractive.
but he is getting married this month.
but those men are rude and you do not want them anyway.
say, "will you go out with me?"
and get married only after you have been with a man for more than two years.
a man has a penis and a woman has a clitoris.
ignore the bad and move on!
however, it would be easier if i was angry!
if she tells the administration i will be expelled because it is pakistan, not america
you should get to know her. sooner or later you will ask her out or vice versa.
as i said, he knows you are interested in him, so take a deep breath and ask him.
perhaps you and i can get together sometime; we may find love.
i would be, however i just got married.
explore your options for a while.
do not get married so early in the relationship.
have you seen a doctor yet?
you should pay attention to that the other person is saying.
simply discuss the subject with your spouse.
given your attraction to sixth grade children, you're apparently youthful.
i've been contemplating a mid-level pink hue, however, what should it be alongside?
inquire of their desire to travel to a location accompanied by you.
a visit to an amusement park with a roller coaster. perhaps a theatrical museum.
do men truly prefer bigger women?
my concern is that i'm deeply attracted to him.
i believe they do work out, although not often. i hope i helped.
should i break up with him because of his mother?
i accidentally did this before and my friend was angry that i had deleted him.
i do not mind either way.
you could try it her way or you could try keeping your eyes open.
you should be able to tell the few that will.
are you talking about your avatar?
i dont remember giving a woman a christmas gift unless i liked her.
i do not know what to do.
try to be yourself and do not try to impress anyone.
just take it day by day and think of how he lost a good thing.
darn it, if only every man had knowledge of what women want, the world would be a much better place!
compliments, be honest and focus on her.
i believe she will wreck him!
it just means that she seems to be really interested in the man.
please do, i am thinking you would be slapped as you reach out or perhaps kicked in the groin.
except now we are both divorced.
if he/she wants to see your photograph immediately, then it is sex.
it is better than her giving you a false phone number to call.
tell her to move to massachussetts.
if you feel that strongly about it, then perhaps you should not get married.
from the pictures that i have seen, i would say maui or the bahamas.
the man i like is upset with me.
you are 13, do not even worry about it.
that way you do not have to worry about phoning him too much!
i am a man, and let me tell you, we love to chase!
thank you in advance for the support!
we seem to always push away the ones who we love.
the believe that they can control others lives when they cannot.
that is weird, but perhaps i will talk to my friend near his locker.
i do not know; how would you feel if something were in your anus?
if a man cares he will call.
what special gift can i give my would-be brother-in-law for his birthday?
he likely does not want to either.
hold her hands, look into her eyes, and say it; but only say it if you really love her.
some guys do, and some guys do not.
can you help me get to know her?
the timing was not right to date the older guy.
i want a girl who is kind, and intelligent.
determination is one of the gifts we can give ourselves.
i don't believe you need to earn someone's trust, how is that possible?
so if that is you, you need to stop, it is too bizarre.
don't let her control your life, she will have to learn to live with it.
i have a yahoo account, and that is fine with me.
i wouldn't worry too much about it.
oh yes, the trick that person never had a chance.
when you can fart in front of the one you are dating.
depends on how old they are.
any man that states he would is more than likely not being entirely honest with himself.
if you bat your eyes at him, the challenge is nonexistent.
if you need your ex emotionally, then you do have some problems.
twenty to thirty-two, she does not have to be younger than you.
perhaps she doesn't love you, but attempt to use your brain and not your head.
if you want to spend forever with her, do not tell her.
there are plenty of inexpensive ideas. find what you are interested in and work from there.
if you are worried about your performance, do not.
find another woman. if that does not work, move back.
most often (although not always), there will be men who are approximately your age.
if you act in that manner at all times, she might find you desperate.
not everyone here is in school.
communicate to him what you really want and speak up; that is what they tell me but i never got to do.
should i make the first move or wait for him to do so?
you have set up a double standard.
after some time, you will not see the color.
i am still trying to work up my nerves to try that out.
if it is serious between the two of you, then that question should not bother her.
what is up with her?
try using the phrase, "would you like to go out with me sometime?
if you are in florida, look me up.
those were the best of times.
it is all about her and it should not occur on the first date.
you have do decide whether you want to spend the rest of your life with someone with whom you constantly argue.
if he comes to his senses, great; if not, you should move on.
you deserve more than them.
she likes him so you are going to jump him?
either a cd or a dvd will be appropriate.
star fresh and be all that you can.
i would like to visit the united states. what do i need to bring?
if anyone has any ideas, tips, or general information, email me back please!
you sound like a lovely person, so do not let some of these women drag you down.
do not look. just go out, enjoy yourself, have fun, and a girlfriend will come along.
do not pursue it because he is getting married.
is it like a clear liquid that turns yellow when dry?
if your country has a short messaging system in cell phones then find a someone to text with!
then when she starts to close her eyes, kiss her lips. after that it is up to you!
please be honest, i can handle the truth.
have fun. and remember to never get so comfortable that it becomes predictable!
it shows how much they care about you.
tell her that you miss her and love her.
coffe, lunch, site seeing, walk, talk, play in the park, museum and move matinee.
what you want is a hooker, you can find that in any corner of the world.
now we do all these things together and i don't know what to do.
if it fails, you will be in trouble.
it had been the best thing for me.
if these coupons apply, try using some of these.
he cheated on me, and it was the worst thing that he could have done.
is he not treating you well? you should be happy.
we really like it when men go out of their way for us and think about us.
perhaps if you give him space, he will eventually return your call.
explain to him that you do not want a real relationship.
if you appear creepy and you look, they will think you are leering.
i do not know about love, but he is certainly attracted to you.
if the guy really respects you, then he will understand.
ask yourself, decide if you can afford to do it, and then go ahead if you would like to.
since he is a superhero, that is the closest thing to being an average man.
sometimes, if the good outweighs the bad, then the difficulties are worth it.
i do not think it is wise to date people from work.
you require a theory class for that.
allow it take its course from there.
what they think about gay marriage or relationships?
so, of course, i had to ask him if he was ignoring me.
guys will find you attractive, no matter what.
do not think that by not having sex that he will become unfaithful to you or leave.
the safe rules of internet dating are to talk through email and messenger, and to talk on the phone.
marraige is about trust and communication.
i have had this problem too.
it depends on what you kissed.
it depends on if you were previously able to trust him.
ensure that you do not make her hate you merely so that you may explain your point.
where have you been meeting these filipino women?
imagine if it was merely considered love.
if you say it that way, you are not telling them specifically what you do not like about them.
if he is single, go for it.
see if she is avaliable for dinner and a movie.
i apologize, but i do not know. i wish the both of you luck.
i find him looking at me every now and then.
it is a sin. we have to start this, ourselves.
fun includes eating meats, and i do not mean breakfast.
make a kind move, if there is not response, you know what to do.
let him make the first move. if you do that, you may look like you are obsessed with him.
you should not get married.
our tragic love story is simply that we loved each other substantially.
you will never find a significant other, if you appear to be despondent.
he asserts that we are only friends.
looks do not really matter unless you are trying to prove something.
once you have sex with him, he'll no longer be a good friend.
when a man is self centered, that's a great turn off.
don't rush it. feel your emotions come alive.
it is a two way traffic until you get them. you will know which one it is.
so, you have one baby out of wedlock?
i know i am overly picky about people. how do i stop that?
it hurts, a lot. maybe some women may say that is it?
i am going to fight that man, is that the right choice?
it was a good idea after all.
it does not turn her off if she gets intoxicated.
because some women send subtle messages to men rather than being clear.
although it may be off-topic, i would prefer to be left alone by them.
ask her to do something that interests her or to a film she would like to see.
you are a man. however, i use that term with levity.
that is amusing. it is unfortunate that it is not automatic as msn and aol are.
and that is how they will react to it so yes, it is a bad situation for you and him.
return to that person immediately before it is too late.
i am laughing because i too would like to cause her smile to depart by means of assault.
ask if he would like to dance with you.
she might say, "that it is ugly, i think prefer this color."
tell him to visit a doctor.
i never went out with him again.
to begin with, why did the two of you break up?
go ahead and do it. there is no use in waiting.
no one else's opinion matters as long as he does not mind.
i think i am still in love with him.
after that time, i never wanted to have sex again.
the important thing is to not try to get revenge on the one who wronged you.
if you need to ask others, then i really do not think that you are ready to.
i am a girl and i say those things.
a big area of savings is flowers.
time will tell; try it for six months and see what the outcome is.
either that, or you are the only person he has a chance to be with.
from the list you compiled, i would have picked spiderman.
my partner cheated on me for three years.
all seniors believe freshman girls are easy, it is unfortunately true though.
you can tell him if he says yes.
you can impress her with love and affection.
what was it like?
you should celebrate valentines day with joy and fun. give eachother gifts and have fun.
any women besides the ugly men will look attractive.
when i moved in my neighbor asked me out.
you should probably make a move because he is obviously shy.
it is just on a much harsher scale as time goes on.
be yourself and say hello, and you might get a response.
there are many times that you love the guy but are not sure he loved you also.
if you are talking about my husband i would say tools, toys for his vehicle, and sports related things.
that got me really hot, but i left.
i will pick up the tab if i can get your vote for best answer.
ok, so what breast size does the average guy like?
many twenty-two-year-old women are dating twenty-seven-year-old men, so the men their age feel insecure and have to fish downstream.
lust less, and simply try dating?
they probably know that you cannot really hide, but you should tell your parents.
i will make you a princess on the planet krypton!
before we met, my last girlfriend's boyfriend did that to her, and she still stayed with him.
my friend has a boyfriend whom she talks to online and over the telephone.
do you like false nails or manicured ones?
tell her, girls like to hear the truth; best of luck.
we are able to wrestle around and be the best of friends.
stay true to your husband, after all he is the person who you said "i do" to.
do not listen to these fools with all of their nonsense.
i am a guy so i do not really have to pay.
remember that no bird ever flew with one wing.
just let her know what you feel.
it depends on whether you truly love him. if you do, then you might want to acknowledge it.
if either one of you is married, then you have to run.
men do not, only little boys.
please help me win this debate with her.
my girlfriend is the zealous person i know, and i love her more for it.
the answer is to play with it.
you need to let him go. if you are meant to be, he will come back to you.
after 3 days of work, my hurt my back.
get your old life back so you can stay alive.
that is the reason why i asked if men ever know what they want in a relationship.
perhaps you should ask him out to lunch, movie, or something similar.
women do not like men that are only about themselves.
it depends on whether you like either one or not.
i kept looking and always picked the imbeciles.
one does what feels comfortable to them. so, no, i feel it is a choice.
some do not have it in them, but some do.
do what makes you happy.
for some reason, i cannot.
so, it would have to be love.
because...you know...try to search your love, but be careful!
do not ask her to perform some act for you. make her the spotlight.
girls are impressed when you simply show them a little care, respect, and honesty.
tell the jerk to get out!
they think it is the only right way!
keep it cool, and good luck!
that said, you have to figure out if you want to stay married to him.
and for that, i hate him.
men like this typically become wife beaters, if you do not obey them!
first of all, i have four children, so i know being a homemaker is more work than my actual job is.
no i have not, i prefer normal-looking men.
he, definitely appears to have feelings for you. you should show him how you feel.
everything seem to be so open. it is hit-an-miss with do many people these days.
maybe i told this man too much, my quandary is unloading all my baggage up front.
choosing the right date can save much money.
if you truly love your new man and want to work things out, then tell your ex to respect that.
that quality makes her easier to lie in bed with.
i don't think you should try doing that.
the concept is simple. treat them honestly and with love.
i am hoping for atleast 90%, but realistically i think it is more like 70-65%.
but cuddling up with a large woman is one of the best feelings i know.
and women also expect guys to act like that, so why should they grow up?
a couple of ways would include getting him drunk.
the problem is not if you ask her while at work or not.
stick with the thirteen and fourteen year old teenagers, they are easier to control. good luck.
you should never let a man mistreat you.
post script: i am not a stay-at-home romantic type of woman.
when i left him, i swore i would never marry again!
pickup lines are tacky. be yourself and complement her often, women like that.
you will be fine, just have fun!
not all the time. sometimes men chave them, it depends on the woman.
i love him, but i think i am ready to move on and meet new men!
so wait another four years.
i hope i see some of it soon.
i do not want to be mean.
also, you should wait awhile before having children.
i would enjoy having some fun with you, that is why i answered this ridiculous question.
attempt to contact their q&a team, they will assist you, have a wonderful day!
because women do not have sexual relations often...
if he insists it means that he is only after intimacy.
looks absolutely matter, any person saying that they do not is more than likely fibbing.
while "making love" seems to be a fantasy.
when you are 18 or 20 because when they say things they are insincere.
when possible, attempt to make it yourself.
but (there is always a "but," is there not?)
if she is not interested in you any longer.
i sincerely doubt that you are in love with that many men.
i would estimate an average of 45% initially but then, once you become acquainted with the person, perhaps 15%.
participate in sports with your male friends.
she will inform you if it is not acceptable.
i did not intend to ask "do you think women are sexually attractive and beautiful?"
how can i get him to stop pestering me?
buy a toy specifically for intercourse that you both would enjoy.
bald men look like children to me, i don't find it attractive.
i agree, kiss him, and he will have a response for you.
something you can o is imagine your life with out him or her.
here in america, it is not very important...
well, if it was prior to you, then he was not cheating at all, obviously.
how many times i let a great opportunity go from worrying about some person telling me no...
because the white females are taking all of the men!
your reputation is also very important.
have you ever received a pap smear?
wow, how many years of age are you?
but i believe that they both have affection for me.
okay, well, first, it sounds as if you two are already married.
yes, jaime is going to ask rubi to go steady, but it is not your business..
that is a sign, conditions like that, can make it really obvious.
you should take the time to get to know both of them, equally, without going out with either of them.
thank you, i would love to hear some logical opinions on this matter.
if you like the man, then go for it.
having fun with male friends is alright.
so, it is natural with that man.
women take on a lot, and sometimes they feel like they do it for nothing.
no, because i am not married, yet.
let me know what you think. thank you.
if you are a homosexual, be yourself.
hold on and stay strong and good luck!
i like older girls, so i believe that it is disturbing and wrong that they can not go out with her.
i am curious about everyone's thoughts.
my last boyfriend i met while driving around a roundabout in a different car.
if you do, then you are going to loose your friend over a man.
i said it casually, i do not think he would remember.
are you a country woman or a city woman?
you can try hanging out all day long together and then you can top it off by giving him a foot massage.
i am very disinterested with being single and sitting back watching the other women have all of the pleasure.
females have curiousity regarding sex with other females, myself included!
i have no idea what your remarks were since my excessive laziness prevented me from reading what you'd typed.
i despise it personally. i adore the variety that's straight.
this is doc izzy, and i love big women!
there are no words that will make it better.
do it before it is too late.
well, to tell you truth you will have to do it to learn.
navy pier is a great place, or a museum. there are many great restaruants and hotels.
that is a stereotype. i would like to inform you that i am a rural woman. i think i am sexually attractive in my own way.
he will not reject you.
i hope that you read this very carefully.
many men like women who are heavy. most of them are black.
if she is interested then she will telephone you later.
no, you will not, because you know he has cheating tendencies.
ask yourself that, if you know what i mean.
i find that if i try hard, i can see things i know are not there, that normally is.
let us get coffee and chat. we will take it from there.
move on with your life and find someone else.
i believe you are not ready for a relationship, but email me at atilikethickchix@yahoo.com and i will be honest with you.
i have been dating a boy on and off since last year.
i really care about you and cannot stop thinking about you when we are apart.
it is worth the wait, when you are ready.
if you don't know the answer, ask someone who would know.
keep your fear at bay and tell him.
that is a chance that you are going to have to take.
so drink up, if you want to be attractive to deadbeats, vagabonds, and deviants.
not good for anything besides looking at.
after a while, it passes and i still love him.
as you said, it is your own life.
and now, i am stuck with it, despite my divorce!
just because he has the potential to be a great boyfriend, does not mean that he is.
sure, let me know more about you.
it is frustrating when one minute you would like to beat-up the person and the next minute you want to have sex with them.
the girls who are pretty or have a great personality.
people whose parents will take care of them are very lazy people.
i do not know what it is that she wants.
it seems very complicated; could you please explain it again in simple terms?
show her what you do well at.
if you can imagine him as the father to your children!
if you do not ask, another person might.
haha, that is why i am not seeing anyone!
you would let him go if you like him.
try to be friendly to here even if she says she does not want to be with you.
believe him if he tells you he is not that way.
let us try to overcome feeling stalled out.
i was employed there for some time and met the man of my dreams.
i have been with my husband for four years. we recently married, in december of 2005.
focus on the reality of the circumstances and consider what would be best for you at the moment.
you will find that no matter how hurt you are, the simplest things will still cause you to smile.
i did not realize that pakistan is that conservative.
i have to stop immediately because i am ready to relieve myself.
no matter what you decide to do, do not advise him too soon.
we cannot know whether she is sincere.
i do not find a man appealing who behaves that way frequently.
when that occurs, your decision will be easier to make.
i have had intercourse with many women and some were prostitutes.
he dribbles, shoots, and scores two points.
speak with your best friend and determine if it is agreeable.
is this a misleading question?
i do not know. can i do anything about it?
people are married for a reason.
if he does not go out with you, do not worry as there are plenty of other options.
do you just want to say that?
if you are not happy, fix it or get out.
not all men, but some do.
i completely agree with udaman. good luck girl.
sounds like you enjoy selling yourself too much.
your girlfriend will think you are a dolt.
you have to observe the one you call yours.
are you replaying everything you ever did to me?
do not sit around waiting for the phone to ring.
i dated a guy this last year and he became violent.
you need to leave it alone, she in in enough pain.
how could any one person know if they do not know anything about you?
just locate one that loves you too.
it never harms anyone to flirt a little!
we were all having a get together.
don't use pick up lines, they don't work.
i love them because i am a man, and i don't need to ask to dance.
there a plenty of men that are attracted to larger women.
women who complain about receiving flowers are ungrateful.
you need to be with that person because you have found your true love.
i mean really be her friend.
how do i get my sweetheart to show me that he loves me?
basically you have to stop talking to him and stop thinking about him.
they have never met but she says that they are in love.
do not do this via phone, e-mail, etc.
i am not against homosexual people and they are the best friends a person can have.
i met a woman and i want to know how to know if she is interested in me.
death is just an unfortunate end.
try to make the best out of a bad situation.
you should either move on, or work it out with your partner.
she is the love of my life, i can't wait to spend the rest of my days with her.
women think with their brains.
i am still in love with my ex and feel angry at my cousin as i believe my ex is attracted to her.
only time will tell. spend time with friends and enjoy yourself, do not think about it.
that is why i do not go to chat rooms anymore, unless it is for entertainment.
this is what i did. it was a mistake.
i do not know where to begin.
he cheated. i can lift or carry my husband.
if she is calling to ramble on, inform her not to call you as often.
that is all i have to say.
you should not be asking this question.
i was also considering lime green.
i mean the both of you together.
i have a close female friend.
they want to be someone else?
can you imagine yourself in bed with him at night?
i love it because of the challenge.
fair skinned women have a tendency to look paler when their hair is black.
wow, i ought to do that the next time that i am dating.
do not listen to anyone else's advice.
i really care for this man and i do not know whether it is a mere attraction or if i love him.
i think "the bomb" is much simpler.
it is not always the easiest choice but they have been fairly satisfying years.
do not forget to choose and vote for best answer.
you tell her why you like her.
did i become homosexual or is it curiosity?
no, not if you must ask.
the list could continue for some time.
however, he may enjoy all of the waiting, dreaming and flirting.
do not eat in the same place you defecate.
certainly. if you do want to chat you can get in touch with me at fla_cat_blue@yahoo.com.
when he teases you about stupid little things.
if you think he feels the same way about you, why not?
in my experience, most of the time one of them ends up cheating on the other.
they are often worse than men.
i have heard of friends getting married after 6 months of being together.
i do not know what you mean.
if you want kids, then be a homemaker.
what is the worst that could happen?
a girl with intellect is just plain sexy!
it is about his or her intelligence, the way they carry themselves, good looks, and physical activity.
yes, and i also would like you to pay mine.
i can simply say yes and mention that i an proud and have long black hair.
i am not going to let her win.
if you would like her to be your friend, it is probable that you would like a deeper relationship.
you should be youself in her presence.
men believe that they are special, and that they are only good enough for specific women.
locate a person you like and ask will you be my valentine!
post additional questions on yahoo answers!
well, if that one boy bullies you, why the attraction to him?
brokeback mountain, okay it is a man, but at least you will be happy!
size, shape, looks, etc., should not matter one iota.
copulation is not the only important matter in life.
you are probably too good for him.
you either like him or you do not.
why don't you ask her permission before you kiss her?
who says country girls feel sexier?
well i do not know your age, which would help.
think about what you enjoy and do it to them, like a tounge massage.
here is my answer, most men do not prefer overly skinny women.
stop speaking to your cousin and your ex boyfriend, completely.
does his friends point at you when you are with him?
yes, it is possible to enjoy giving pleasure rather than receiving it.
now, i keep thinking of being intimate with a woman.
if they are brunette or not is what matters.
she may be trying to use you.
having a big penis doesn't mean you are good in bed.
if you are dating the guy you love you need to get rid of your ex.
it hurts really badly and i bled.
cuddling, kissing, touching and arousing one another prior to having sexual relations.
when he decides to explain to him that it was a bad decision to part ways and i desire to have him once again.
my boyfriend loves me very much and does not desire to lose me.
you are doing that now, so why attempt?
on the hood of the car, at a waterfront in a slight drizzle, it was fantastic!
i think that you are most likely a nice man and she probably loves you very much.
you are searching too strenuously or perhaps you are searching in the wrong locations. you ought to sign up for yahoo! personals.
only if you desire for it to be.
however, if she does not have a reason then she is not your friend.
you must discover what is right for you and your partner or partners.
you definitely do not sleep around, do not worry.
girls do not think it's cool, they believe men who smoke are pathetic as they are killing themselves.
do you like asian food?
they do not mean to get them pregnant. they just are unable to control themselves as they are selfish.
i like natural looking real women, i am not attracted to those who look artificial or cause drama.
that is their take on how the world works, and their desire to catch up.
that is too many and it is selfish. you are desperate and want to keep dating multiple people.
you can not eat chocolate and then decide to mean because you look heavy.
do you know that he loves you?
my wife forgives me for many things.
you order one on the internet and the stork delivers it.
i would say around three or four.
imagine that i am the man you want, and then date me.
give them a chance to discover all of your talents.
it is unusual, but it isn't bad.
i love him still, what should i do?
you don't need to stay together, even if you have a child.
always listen to her and do not change the subject because women hate that.
it can be considered good luck if you consider it good luck.
it is a man thing known as the ego.
it sounds like you are going through plenty of things right now.
good luck but do your homework.
do not come here, it sounds like a trap.
everywhere, merely ask any woman who is passing by. only in thailand, however, not in the united states.
this woman does not want a bad man at all.
but i need to be happy.
you are so bad to tease all those lonely sad men, so shame on you.
also, sometimes men think they do not need you until you are gone.
all that i can say is good luck.
hopefully, you married your husband because you love him.
i love to express my feelings to women by writing poems, and i wonder if anyone else has written a special one.
why tie yourself to one man?
that is if both of you agree to do this.
it is like saying, "what is going to stop me when i have already done it?"
he has to start over and earn your trust, again.
the one of his family i met is his father.
why are we there? we fall in love and they treat us badly.
i want to wait untill i am in love with soemone.
girls do not like being ignored.
if you keep secrets, it hurts the ones you love.
everyone has their own perferances on who they find attractive.
you cannot beat a soft woman, especially if they have curves and big breasts.
never tell her she is obese.
you are a mother, so act like one.
others think according to society's dictates, but i say forget society and give me a curvy woman.
give them 2 months and they will get over you.
daniel has never read a manga book.
it is like you dad is sending his blessing.
i like to date intelligent, fun, and attractive girls.
i will be your girlfriend if you come to my town.
this generation is simply too unintelligent.
yes, it is time to exchange your gambling tokens.
the are perpetually in the "in love" stage.
i see a malaysia air airplane on the television and it makes me crazy.
he asked me out very nicely.
try talking, and ask her out as a friend. see if it goes somewhere.
this is difficult due to the many temptations.
that is not what you can become.
the two of you should talk privately and personally. you have to hear eachothers side.
the song i liked went like this.
do not try to have sex.
you should play a little hard to get.
i believe you should be ready even if your relationship survives the four seasons.
do you know why, besides love, i married my man.
move on and find someone who does not abhor you.
let us start assuming it since you cannot.
of course we like pretty, good smelling flowers.
should i try this relationship, younger man versus older woman.
alright, these other replies are presumptuous, i am much more accomplished.
lime green is a better color for a summer wedding.
if they cannot exercise self conrol, allow them to marry.
my male friend snores and i have the most awful time sleeping!
maybe you do not think so, but yes!
we do not have room for messed up animals like this in our society.
the best way, and the easiest way, is to fly or drive to las vegas and get married there.
his answer works for me.
no man can give you what you want.
leave him if he misbehaves.
if you are also very attractive you should show him your breasts.
there are a lot of males who are like that, only looking for sex.
i mess up a lot at times and she does not forget.
unless you are very desperate wait for him to ask you out.
you are asking do you like me?
whatever you decide, you make it completely yours.
her parents? you cannot fix it. her friends? perhaps you can speak to them nicely, but please specify as to why?
how intoxicated will this girl be?
women love men with a positive self-image.
i am only doing this for the points.
if you do not know anything about one another you will not be able to connect.
if you do, then i would say that it is real and worth a relationship; i wish you luck.
if you are used to it and you sort of like it, go forward with it.
it's buy one take one.
and last but not lease, does he always just happen to be staring?
it sounds like a con, but i am telling you, women like it.
you have met unintelligent women that think being skinny is better.
i believe there is a difference between having sex and making love.
you have to force yourself to walk away.
i think it is around 80%.
leaning in and giving me a soft kiss on the forehead.
i cannot picture my life without my husband.
i do. it is much more pretty and smooth as silk!
however, flowers are really nice even if they do not last.
it sounds like he is enjoying himself too much while you are away.
why do you not just leave that girl alone?
perhaps you should try dating girls if you are so offended by boys.
i also do not have one girlfriend.
just remember to pursue men who are themselves and do no act like someone else.
they feel as if they are better than women, but they are incorrect.
this does not, however, mean that you should admit them.
it is always in the back of my mind.
does she have other friends with whom she can talk on the telephone?
getting married and having children can be postponed, but your studies cannot be.
you must, however, do this several times.
a lot of teen boys prefer girls that like sex.
enjoy the friends you have and do not look back.
your personal belief is not good or bad.
i do not know what i should do.
that is disgusting.
you will not lose your charm at twenty five years of age.
my best friend wants me to break up with my boyfriend.
just relax and be cool.
i don't think so. maybe they should try taking our last names.
both of you should pick either his or yours once you have kids.
of course he wants to go on.
so i guess my pick is domestic goddess.
after class, ask her out again.
people, life is too short! live it to the fullest, and have faith!
i am a man, and i feel this as well, because i am as well!
if you like him that much, then phone him!
start with a simple common question and proceed from that point.
tell more people, as my brother did.
all my friends would like to do is engage in heavy kissing.
additionally, engaging in kissing and inquiring as to your kissing abilities.
we will not regret it. we are happy to help any time.
you need to add it back like you did the first time.
you can share this with your mom or dad.
do not fall for the alcoholic, only on the weekends line is a sign.
you have stuck yourself out there to get hurt, unless you know him fairly well.
i prefer a and b cups, myself.
be her friend first and then see where that leads.
do not even listen to what people (not only men) say, observe how they behave.
do you feel that way?
however, if a man asks you, do not be afraid to say no.
obviously, she does not want to be with you if you know that she is interested in another boy.
there are many things that deter women from sex.
not all gentlemen break up with their woman.
your best friend is a good choice to marry in nobody else works out.
are you looking for friendship?
i do this with my current boyfriend.
it does not mean you can not love another.
you need to divorce the guy, he has no honor and does not love you.
men want to have a girlfriend for the free sex.
if nothing works, you have to ask him for it again.
it is your personality that will attract a guy. it should not determine how you act.
you will have to find an answer yourself.
you will not need to prove anything if the guy is worthy enough.
what should i do? i do not want to be like that.
you ought to comparison shop for invitations as well as everything else.
he then asked me, "may i come with you?"
if you're honestly attracted to her, go with your emotions.
i'm only myself around men i'm not attracted to. i'm sure you understand the outcome.
i hope you find a kind women.
i have been attracted to this women since i was in ninth grade.
to my fellow females at cone, hi and a great embrace!
there is a reason that she likes him.
if going to a movie, is special for the two of you, then you should do that.
it sounds like you are the boss.
have you ever told her that it is a rather annoying that she checks up on you everyday?
it goes the other way too; think girls prefer slender and toned gentlemen.
he gave me his cellphone so i could put my number in it.
either go to hawaii or pay someone.
why do people frown on this topic?
you will find "mrs. right."
if you are planning to be unfaithful to your wife then you are disgusting and should be shot.
he already knows that you care for him. has he said anything about it?
confront him and ask him so that you will know.
it is more of an issue of trust, in my opinion.
never stop trying to impress her.
no, you are being punished. no television for one month.
i believe this is better than the one on top of me.
but that did not bother me because, as i said, we were merely friends.
go to school; you can still come home or call your family and friends.
you should choose the one who chooses you because, nine times out of 10, he likes you.
i always felt similarly, but after i met my true love, my views changed.
take baths? know how to speak?
i like him and he makes statements such as, "if i were single, i would date you."
leave him and you will be better off.
the one time in your life to live out the fantasy of love.
people asked me, "what's the hurry?"
has he broken up with a woman and abandoned her in the past?
i am now thirty-six years old and still in therapy because of it.
and for heaven's sake, do not become one of thos controlling baby mamas.
did you ever think of that?
it has been 6 months and i wonder if it is normal for me to still like him.
look for a sexy man.
it really is sweet and just what you are looking for.
is there an excuse that you are not with the father of the child?
no! it definitely is very bad. you are simply wasting your health because girls just dislike it.
anything that is larger than a handful is a waste, more than likely a size c or d.
i myself believe that they do.
cease attempting to slap it in every persons face!
you should be searching in a public place. wherever you are most comfortable.
a man asked me, "do you mind if we cuddle?".
questioning the score of last game?
some couples never get to the comfortable, boring stage.
i always say that you shouldn't do something you will regret later.
even the next day would probably work.
all you need to do now is smile.
the same situation has happened to me as well.
although, i do not really like women all that much.
be very nice, give eye contact, and smile a lot. i hope this helps.
i would wonder why he shaved them, but in the end, they are his legs.
best of luck to both of you.
this is merely what i have heard many times.
i prefer anything natural over false. i even hate the word "false."
no, ten years younger. who would want an older woman?
ask your best friend if it would be fine.
many people will tell you "no."
i like to go dancing at clubs in downtown huston.
who said that women do not feel anything?
do not start with how she looks.
if they have moved on, then you should, too.
flirt, and see how he responds.
i am waiting until i get married. when do you think that will go too far?
there is nothing wrong with her taking you phone number.
you do not have to be a overly, jubilant, hyper-active person.
i do not want to randomly go up and ask them to go out with me.
then comes the fun part, him making it up to you.
foreplay is important and should last, at the bare mininum, five minutes.
i cannot assist any further without more information.
because i say no on avatars.
some women prefer non-perishable gifts which are long-lasting.
he probably wants to know if you're interested in him.
i feel silly, strange, and exuberant.
if you're promiscuous, then he is as well.
some men only say that word, if they mean it.
i don't need a high maintenance woman, i want a companion
as a man, i want to say something.
be confident, and always believe in yourself. don't be arrogant. make great eye contact. listen to her.
after he asked, "do you want to use some of my chapstick?".
there are no directions to kissing.
we love them, it isn't until later that we regret what we have done.
i don't believe i have an answer, because i myself am in the same predicament.
what was the mistake you made?
it is akin to breaking a drug habit.
tell him, and it would not seem psychotic, because you have to know one another for awhile.
yes, for the first answer. the woman answered for me.
what about blue or green?
a life that belongs to you alone, a life you have been missing out on.
that is confusing. yes, i think you are correct.
the answer is that you do not have to invite her on a date in order to go on a date with her.
possibly he will call you.
okay, speak to her, but be as polite as possible.
i lost my virginity in a park when i was sixteen.
what man does not like large breasts?
you should be very pleased with yourself.
yeah, males work and repair things, but what other things can you accomplish?
we are unaware of what you look like.
if you could have four qualities in a woman, what would they be?
if you search the internet, local newspapers, or watch the news, you can find a lot of things for weddings.
if she sits on your friends lap due to intoxication, then yes, it is a turn off.
do you see my partner?
you will find a man that deserves you.
i like the perfume that you wear.
if you are not ready, then forget him.
why do they want it sanctioned by the state?
she lets me work on my trucks and watch cartoons.
you can still love him, just move on.
see if he is willing to go out of the way for you.
if anyone knows, please let me know.
i never knew that life could be so exceptional.
also, he said that he would call me back.
chose the one whom you like the most.
turn off your pop up blocker.
if you honestly love him then you will tell him.
i would absolutely enjoy that happening to me.
what should i do to attract her attention?
my friend, you have to seize the opportunity and introduce yourself.
there are movies that i have not seen yet.
i believe that it all depends on age and nurturing.
that will be just intercourse.
my significant other was definitely my friend first. that makes it complete euphoria.
who cares what anyone else thinks.
try getting some blonde highlights.
find a medium that works in order to vent.
make her a mix tape or cd.
what is you choice of the options and why?
do not worry about what others say.
many women enjoy getting flowers.
i cannot explain it; however, it has nothing to do with them looking young, vulnerable, or submissive.
you should either let him go or date his brother.
they do exist; you simply have to look.
you can purchase them at staples for $35.
your child is going to have hard enough time growing up without a father.
my friend says that i am too nice and that i should tell them, "no."
my special woman always says that she loves me while we are passing notes during class, but she does not say it confrontationally.
that is correct, the right relationship happened all on its own.
you will look like an imbecile.
if you admire him, then you should not care, stay with him.
i think you should be true to yourself and have self-esteem and self-confidence.
anything that cannot be easily moved.
if you really want to keep company with her that much, than you have to make it your top priority.
my older sister had a relationship with one of my best friends, a few months ago.
should i just forget and move on?
on the other hand, their friends are a different story.
absolutely, i do think that anyone would.
my cousin met up with an outlandish mature deviant, that she met online, he had told her that he was a salacious teenager.
none are on my list so i select my neighbor's wife.
i have long black hair and both my husband and i are quite fond of it.
if you care for your family then everyone in your family will love you.
unattractive and overweight men simply accept what they are able to get.
in the middle of the river while people were watching. it was actually fairly amusing.
it is all in the eye contact.
it depends on the man, some do, some do not.
it is giving us the idea that you may not have fortitude.
if you love each other, then he may want to disappoint his father.
absolutely, some men get right down to it with absolutely no thought for the woman.
perhaps she is not a shrew, but the thin woman definitely was.
it does sound a hint adolescent.
if you want an enjoyable date, check out a few restaurants, night clubs, gyms, etc.
there are a lot of good women out there, you just have to look in the correct places.
hello, everyone is going to separate some day.
sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, just be careful next time.
happy birthday to you!
i need someone to help me understand this.
pick the one that you feel will be the best treatment for you.
i am interested in a boy in the 6th grade too!
i do not date my guy friends, beaause if you break up, you might not be friends anymore.
you need to do more then make eye contact.
what is best for the both of you?
he had bad teeth, bad breath, and body odor.
no one needs to know that information.
if i am to ask, i will then leave and stop the relationship. then i would move on with my life.
do not take it the wrong way.
i asked him if he still liked me. he said yes, but he did not act like it.
where am i going with this?
keep getting her younger and younger, and when one gets old you get a new one to replace her.
you would know that if you did not play the guilt trip.
that does not mean it makes it right, it just means that it makes us human.
it is a mistake that cannot be reversed.
practice unwrapping starburst with your tongue, and tying cherry stems with your tongue.
you caught her looking at you?
i know of three men that i can probably get away with doing something like that.
tell her that you are attracted to her and then ask her to go out with you.
if he is going to be an'on and off' man, then i would say to break up with him permanently.
if they do not, then you will have to continue on with your life.
i have never been there.
compliment her, ask her name, act like yourself and like you are the most dapper guy ever.
she calls him frequently.
how should i approach her, without her thinking i'm just another man with bad intentions?
wait for a little bit, and then date other men that you enjoy spending time with.
someone who is never judgmental because they believe is cool, is usually judgmental.
you don't have any power to make that decision.
i know, so why should i be forced to conceal it?
some guys do not like to dance.
she is not your friend if she will not stop bugging you.
i wish i listened to my friends.
after how much time can you conclude that she is not interested?
do i desire to be in love?
why do they desire to be married?
easy, oh, and brilliant photograph of george clooney on your profile, haha.
some women cannot seem to locate males their own age that are attractive.
some may, but i would otherwise have a pair that were not too large.
it sounds as though you are both comfortable with things as they are.
very sexually attractive. yes, it looks very nice on most any woman.
sometimes it is better to be friends first and ensure that you are happy around each other.
my question is: will i always feel that way?
listen to faith hill's song "love ain't like that." it is a very good example.
please do not ask that question if you do not want your feelings hurt.
and if she loves you, your girlfriend should accept that.
i think it is very sexy when a man shaves his legs.
i do not think it is the best thing for you two to stay in touch.
i'm fond of this boy, austin, and i informed my companion, claudia, to inquire as to whether or not he feels the same toward me.
you are murdering the romantic behavior by asking that inane query. alternatively, have you considered partaking in enjoyable activities as a couple?
he has a player position. no skills, believe me.
it's dependent upon other things. they're all fond of various selections, however, not self-involved reprobates such as yourself!
in my opinion, it's terrific; perhaps the initial turn should be yours to take!
if he rejects you, he was not worth it to begin with.
just walk up to her.
it is wise to always be honest. besides, i do not know many guys who dislike complements!
they know women will not pursue them like they would a handsome or wealthy man, they get loads of women.
ask him if he would like to go to the movies with you.
that is what is known as, sexual intimacy.
smile towards him occasionally, then he will start to get the picture.
most women are polite, so she'll answer your question.
you sound very similar to my best friend, so i would.
say hello and ask him when he is taking you to dinner.
it really depends on the man, but i think most men really do not care.
it will work out if you want it to.
if he does not want to dance, then give it up.
but you know, i think it is up to the man to make the first move.
unless it is with a boyfriend, it is acting a bit like a slut.
take it from a military woman and wait!
they never show affection except when they want something.
i am 49 years old and seeking a beautiful woman to spend some time with and maybe more.
do you mean to seem more sexy?
if you check in the deleted items it should be there.
i wonder if this may be a red flag about the way this man is.
no offence but perhaps because your name is "freakgirl" but if you were to show your face perhaps not.
that would be very painful, trust me i have done it.
do you love her deeply?
enjoy yourself in prison, asking that question of your cellmate.
no, the only time a man will be emotional is in the presence of his female lover.
yes, i have done it. it was very entertaining.
you must tell the person with whom you are in a relationship what you want.
of course, if she calls about that five times a day, that would be ridiculous.
wait for the one that will appreciate you for you.
my mother books trips at "pat@alanatvl.com"
he probably has many things to worry about right now other than you.
i have been in a relationship with a man that is younger than me.
men play with love to get sex, women play with sex to get love.
it has to be overplayed after a while.
everyone enjoys compliments on their appearance, even if they do not admit it.
yes, it depend upon the man.
perhaps it's because you believe they appear sexy when they are running.
you're too young to be speaking about kissing.
i probably will inform her soon. she's my best friend. any assistant would be great.
i agree with the other individual. before anybody gets injured.
i love him, but i am also ready to move on.
you should go out and do everythign you could not when you were with them.
men are not much better.
you would have to tell him that you only want to be friends with benefits.
play a game of truth or dare together.
he sounds like a real manipulative jerk.
slow down the pace and maybe try some foreplay.
death is like a big black bag full of crack cocaine, smack, or methadone.
do you want to practice kissing me? where do you live?
no, you will not, dear, because i was married to a total jerk.
it sounds like you really love her so you do not have to forget her.
tell him that you just want to be friends and that you are really sad that he would act so silly.
things always come out in the open, so do not do it.
also, i am disgusted by chest hair and do not understand the appeal.
at the moment, i think he is angry, upset and unwilling to be with you.
give your brother some money and inform him that he ought to leave.
i do not intend offense but that sounds like a woman's name.
remain calm and ask her on a date.
after you take her on a date, get to know her better then ask her to be in a relationship with you.
people do not enjoy being played with as though they were a yo-yo.
practice being able to unwrap starburst candies with your tongue. women enjoy it.
i do not know. i merely want the points.
that is not entirely true, it is just that most women are discreet in reference to it...
that depends, are you an attractive individual with an athletic form?
i let him know it was too late, other than that, it would not have bothered me to receive flowers once in a while.
believing in it is an odd way of putting it.
why can't men or boys ever speak the word love?
just enjoy the age you are and don't worry about other things.
i am 19 years old, but like anyone up to age 30.
i had a friend who was in the same situation.
trust me, girls can be just as perverted.
you should not date a guy because you need to.
what you are saying is she does not want to be more than boyfriend and girlfriend?
does it generally take a year to feel comfortable or bored in a relationship?
i knew all my former girlfriends were not the one until i met my wife.
if you do not base your relationship on intercourse, then it is ok.
some men would do that, why?
if you are an average guy, breast size should not matter.
stay far away from men who cannot say, "i love you."
ask for permission first, and watch how fast she slap the stuffing out of you.
my husband adores me, for me.
this just hits too close to home for me, my mother also, has cancer.
be your best self. if he is impressed he will want to talk.
you do not want anyone else but that specific person.
why not try chatting or seeing other men to see how he reacts?
but it is fine to kiss on the first date.
males have an issue with secrets.
i had someone become quite horrible with me because i continued dating.
so, how do i simply kiss him?
i am the maid of honor for my only sister, and i desire it to be pefect.
unless, it is with the incorrect male.
