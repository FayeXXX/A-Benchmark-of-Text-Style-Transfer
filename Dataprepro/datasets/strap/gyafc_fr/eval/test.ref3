dudes just act like they love a chick to get booty, chicks just act like they like sex to get the attention

ur punishment is no tube for a month.

make a move, she's into you or nit.
i have some friends that only date for 6 months before getting hitched

i feel like i keep getting tempted and it's tough being good.

it is all about when you feel ready enough.

it's just how it is.
it's ok to be online friends but gotta have limits

if he says no, hes not good enough to begin with
to tell u the truth youll learn. but u gotta experience life

it depends on the woman and what she want
i know i have someone waiting for me at home.

if always act like you do now she might think you are desperate
i think there’s definitely a difference from sex and makin lov.

where's your place, i'll come over and we can practice making out
maybe you think no, but i think yes
if you show your face maybe not but since your name is freakgirl
only lil boyz not men
try something like would you like to hangout sometime
it could happen to anyone even me twice
you shouldn't feel obligated to go out with him
well obviously you don't want to be with him otherwise you wouldn't be asking me that.
i hope this doesn't end.
women just want a man to be open about his feelings.
women like to be more into sex.
keep trying to impress her.
lean towards me and give me a soft peck right on the forehead.
i'm not like that, but there's a lot of them out there.
she's self centered and that shouldn't show up on a first date.
it depends on how much you are starting to get into this boy.
thanks for the pep in advance!
why would they want to get married?!?
approach softly and chase us!
do you have any idea why i married my husband?
let's go to an amusement park or a museum.
i like this person but dont know if im in love
do u like fake or manicured nails
plan what u want. dont worry about others
we do these together...i dont know what to do now
i dont get u
he claims he still loves me but don't act like it
that perfume is dope
you should practice unwrapping starbursts with your tongue. chick dig it.
most men don't care i think, but it really depends on the person.
it has nothing to do with being weak, obedient, or naive.
don't get married too early in a relationship.
if you plan on cheating on your wife, you're not cool.
do the very best impression of yourself, and if he's down to clown he'll lip you up
you don't wanna be with anyone else but them
he's getting married, just stop
did you tell her that the day check-ins were annoying?
my neigbhor hit on me asap
most teen boys enjoy teen girls who like sex.
he played basketball well.
don't stress.
you must be a troll
if he liked you more than her, she'd have dumped him
fear, anger, revenge: these are the forces of the darkside
he loved me enough to close the long distant relationship from 1400 miles away to home
u been to a doc yet??
she's no shrew but that thin one was definitely!
dont waste my time...go do something!
its like eating too much chocolate and they bitchin that u got fat
i went there and he was there
go for it he single!
men like him will beat their wives if they don’t obey
do you think he’s hot or not??
if u haven’t yet, tell ur parents if you’re sure
sadly, you're going to get shut down by many people in your life.
do you think he's on the same page when it comes to the feels?
there's that four letter word that a man just can't say unless he really feels it.
he is totally digging you, so you gotta let him know.
i think everyone should keep their damn name.
friends are forever, guys sleep around tho.
think of it like love.
you gotta have your relationship ready for the four seasons.
some guys like some girls, not all types tho.
if you want kids be a stay at home mom.
what do u think of the young guy with the older woman?
he just keeps going
u promised to stay faithful when u got married. remember that.
it'd have to be love there's no alternative
your self image is also important though
well i'm a girl and i say them things
girls can be just as preverted;)
flowers are nice, tho they don't last super long...
there are movies i still haven't seen
she is so sweet, def the person you are looking for!
hey, use your brain not your manhood - maybe she loves you!
ur name sounds like a chick's name, bruh... no diss, tho
meh, don't waste your time calling him back
no women i got the hots for around, i picked my neighbor's old lady instead!
not gonna have a good marriage without trust & communication, dude
don't listen to ppls advice, most of the time they wrong
what do you think i should do to get wit her?
maybe u should give a rose 2 show ur love 4 dem
it's weird but not bad weird.
find what's right for both of you, dude.
they're not kids but we're more mature by far.
yep, like when she puked.
cause you know you should look for your love but carefully!!!
need more info to help more...
kissing is kissing, theres no right or wrong to it.
think it over, don't rush the decision
it sok to have fun with guy friends
justthink about what you like and do it back... bit like a tongue massage
my partner was my friend first and its perfect
i think its more of a trust problem tbh
i need help figuring this out!
u better move on if that man don't want u
he aint interested either...
diy is the way 2 go
why do you always work and fix things?
i really meant it when i told her i loved her.
it just seems like all the male seniors think all freshmen girls are easy.
how do i just kiss him?
you should just check the deleted items, it might be there.
i think you'll find a nice chick to go out with eventually
bad idea, you're not there for that crap
the list is endless, tbh
brokebak mountain and stuff, but... you'll be ecstatic even if it is a dude
don't base your relationship on sex and you'll do fine
i'll tell her soon enough; she's my best friend after all and i know she will offer to help anyway.
you are correct sir! never ever ever look at your future wife before the wedding ceremony begins.
keep calm, hold on, and you'll do great!
uhh it's just a small party for close family members...
don't do it if you aren't sure about the performance portion.
i just got married actually.
it depends on how old they are and how they were raised.
youll have to decide a last name once u have kids.
your kid is gunna have a really rough time with no fathe rin its life.
men that dont have hair are ugly to me, they look like a kid lol.
give it time. if you leave that person, it will be harder to stay friends
find out the score of the last game
if you love him you need to get rid of your x
best way to get hitched... cheap and quick in vegas!
i wanna know more about u
i like c or d size. nothing bigger
just lie and keep lying
i've never seen them perform so it extra awesome!
wife doesn't wear that mess
we don't know how you look!
opposites attract and every pot has its lid
i think its better than my personal life
dont go to the same places with her and you did with your ex
talk with your bro and see if its ok
thats odd.. it worked for me in 3-5 days
it pisses me off when he teases you about small shit.
no, i am not hitched yet.
there are a ton of guys into big girls, and most are black men.
i usually use poems to express how i feel to women, and i wonder if anyone else has written one to someone special in their life.
i told her how i felt, and she told me she was afraid it would mess up our friendship.
stay with him if you care about him, and you shouldn't care what others think.
do they make fun of you when you and him are together?
i love them since i am a dude and no one said i needed a date.
don't get married if you feel this way.
depends on whether a person is full of themself...
ya gotta move on and find someone who doesn't hate ya...
you should be to know her and then one of you guys will ask the other out!
i asked him he was blowin me off...
maybe some younger sick guys like younger asian chicks.
make sure this is your choice.
tell him u want it casual
if he is not treating u well leave. u gotta be happy
its difficult and lots of problems
the past few years have been ok, but not always easy peasy.
srsly, it's been 4, maybe 5 years, and there hasn't been a day we haven't seen each other.
just think of me as the man of your dreams, and be mine.
it never hurt anyone to let their flirt flag fly!
stick to what you kno in your gut.
good luck babes!
well... ive been with this one girl 8 months and not kissed her, is it bad?
gotta be the girls decision!
imo theyre better looking than other countries
it'd be fine the day after
just see if shes free for dinner and a movie
some men are inconsiderate assholes when it comes to women
can you speak english i have no idea what yr saying
i have never felt that, soz
gotta memba, no bird ever flown w/ 1 wing
i think bout this all the time
if u dont stop looking so down youll never find a significant other
i just met a chick and i wanna know if shes into it
keep busy while waiting for the phone to do its thing.
be yourself, don't change for anyone.
ladies who are 22 want 27 year old guys, but the 27 year old guys want the ladies younger than that.
if he don't appreciate you, leave him.
he might really love you. or he's just doing it to hurt is dad.
don't be such a weakling. if you say sorry to him without doing anything wrong you just humiliate yourself.
do it before you run out of time
that girl doesn't need a man who is gonna betray her.
yo what a black girl say bout this
yo help me beat this chick at debate
they're pretty much dudes the same age as you, mostly
when are people ever going to understand?
really, what am i gonna do?
ya go to a bar and drink till your drunk!
i acted that way with my current bf
if you gotta ask... then no...
don't sit around waiting till he realizes how great you are
thought i divorced them but it still goes on....
have a good time it will be ok....
she will just think you are an ass if you do that.
if mom and pop don't like you just be friends with her friiends why?
for me - i woudn't marry a girl who woudn't change her last name but that's just me
you should try to date girls since guys offend you
my ex of 3 years of being together cheated on me
eh, i say give it 6 months - time will tell!!
here is how the one i like went
not all gentlemen break up
its fun to go there. lots to do
can u kiss on first date
i have a close female friend
the want to sex each other
explain that breaking up was a big mistake, and you want to be with him.
i am too nice according to my friends, and i should say no to him.
theres alway san exception right?
some guys do but not every single one.
if you do that then you will be able to keep your last name.
say hello and ask if she has a bf
that turned me on, but i left
fat girls can be hot
all tha ppl here are not here for school.
if u practice over & over u will be able to unwrap bothcherry stems and starbursts with ur tongue like me.
u keep talkin to him so much, he gonna think you r his wife!
if you gimme your vote for best answer, i will pay the bill.
looking in public is prolly the best idea, plus you will feel safe there..
tease him see if he bites....
then i don't have to ask anyone direct.
say yes it'll be fun!
she never forgets when i screw up.
how do i approach her so she doesn't think i'm a guy with bad intentions??
as a guy... let me enlighten you
no prob, you’re just 13.
trail ride with a friend every time all the time.
if it’s meant to be they everything will work out.
eye contact, it’s what it’s all abouut.
he's a weakling, i can pick him up!
he will have to start over to get your trust back.
my boyfriend and i were in second, fourth and eighth grades together.
why would you wanna go out with her?
hopefully you'll review this thoroughly.
play't or d together.
gotta confirm it and go from there.
that's dumb u need a theory class 4 that.
quit if you eat something like that
i want some from that girl.
be blunt and confront him, that's how you will know
jamie's going to ask rubi out.
both of you need to have some guts and end this thing
could be interesting for them to learn about it...
he dribbles he shoots he scores!!! two points!
do guys really like big girls?
he def loves you too, but time will tell...
if he repsects you he'll get it
we're the source of our own sin
that response works for me
u can still like him. but move on
a smart girl is hot
its bad they cant take her out
my sister closes her eyes when she is ready to kiss
lol i met my last bf driving in a roundabout!
he’s getting hitched this month
should i move on and forget about it?
u replaying everything u did to me in your mind?
it is like ur married
why didnt u break up
he may want more space
tell more peeps
you just gotta take it one step at a time and remember he got a good thing
u gotta say "hey booo when we goin to dinner?"
nah, not if u gotta ask
u gotta go 2 school and u can still com home to ur friends and fam
i didn't wanna have sex ever agin
let him come to you. if you go to him, you'll look crazy about him
some people dont do that bc of their relgiion
i hope you're proud of yourself!
it's up to the individual, it's their choice.
if you think about it it might help you decide whether to trust him or not.
i didn't mean to ask if you thought of women as sexy and beautiful.
you need to ask if they feel like they're gonna hurt someone.
i think you really get off on selling yourself.
see if the guy you're into will make that extra effort.
you shouldn't take that to mean that you both are incapable of feeling for each other.
if they really don't know about you at all, then how would they know this?
who cares what people think
if you could have 4 qualities in your chick, what would they be?
chicks like guys with brains.
i feel joy, weird, and odd.
keep cool, you might try being a little hard to get
look the way she walks
he shouldn't give a crap if you both are at a dance.

there are way more men into bigger women than you think, lady.

we really weren't spend that much time together.

women think with their nugget

how long does it take before you realize you've wasted your time and she's not into it?
girls think guys who smoke are awful because they're basically committing suicide.

i have trouble sleeping cause my bf snores like a pig!
it doesn't matter what they think. if they don't hit it off, they should stay apart.

everything that can move easily.

he cheated on me for three years.
beat on him cause he likes someone else?
i think it's better to keep sexy stuff a mystery until you actually go to bed together.
it's not really that important in the usa.
believe in yourself, but don't be stuck up, and look her in the eye and listen to her.
just let it flow like a river
i dated someone just like that, so i know that feel
i wish i listened to my friends
if he don't start acting right, leave him!

we tried to move foward, but it didn't work :(
have courage and go for it
im not talking to my sibling
she'll be polite if you ask

lotsa women nowadays can't find dudes in their own age group they like
doesn't matter, we're just friends
well take some self defense classes then dude

white women are stealing all the men!
if she calls me 5 times i day i’d go crazy!
you only hit that with you
tell that lazy ass to move out!
wow, how many years of age are yuh?
dey believe dat dey can control de lives of others when dey cannot.
yuh would let him go if yuh like him.
someone i can be myself around
the rest is easy
tell them "i love you" it will tell you how they feel
i just got out of a 3 yr relationships with my baby daddy
hope you find your match.
time's passed and i still love him.
he knows and he hasn't said anything yet.
people like what they like.
she's forgiving, my wife.
whatll happen if u want him to be a casual lover
i like him and he would date me if i was single
woman are meaner than men
she could be using you
dont do stuff that can hurt you
ur would be surprised to ee who likes him
wait till ur 25. u will still be great
thats what to do if u gotta
do guys know what they want whwen dating
if ya' need ya''es emoshunally, den ya' are goin' t'gotss' some troubles.
go with it if you feel comfortable and like it some.
don't forget, til death do you part.
just ask for her number, there's nothing wrong with that.
if girls think flowers die, then why do they want them so much?
to focus on her looks is shallow.
it shouldnt bother her if u ask. i mean u guys are dating
id do maui or the bahamas
its a problem to ask her out at work or not
he asked me out in a unique way
you certainly have set up a classic double standard.
i can't say what your wife thinks, but i hope i can give you a helpful viewpoint.
you should be mad and disappointed!
he got off the train when it got to his stop.
start at the top and then keep going a couple of decades.
fear not, little dudes, say no when the answer is no!
ignore what she's spewing, she's in pain right now.
if it doesn't work out you can kiss your job goodbye.
go clubbing and dance the night away!
i have passed great opportunitites involving others to many times
how do i get him to leave me be
when u r 18-20, u says things u dont mean
why did he shave his legs
you should be super nice and make eye contact and smile :)!!
what do other ppl think?
question for guys: what size female do you like
she doesn't want you to just be into her for her lookcs
all i can say is... good luck!
i once said i luv u girl and meant it
get'em if she says yeah
if you wanna be friends, u probably want 2b more than friends
you gotta stop keeping secrets cuz its hurts the ones you love.
be real & have some balls cuz that's what woman want, but be real more.
why do ya care a/b what others say?
a dude that says that isn't being all that honest with himself, imho.
ditch him & go out with his bro!
death gives you cavities like,candy corn
eh i wouldnt want em too big
others like to follow the herd,but i like myself thick girls
that only makes her easier to lay(;
lol if you like him, call him!
coz u don't got any power
ur life, do what u gonna do
cougars like young men so they can feel betta!
i aint the typa chick that like romantic mealz at home
i'm just doing this so i can get more points.
thats just something you are going to have to risk.
don't let him keep you stuck at home because you want to work on your love life.
don't tell him too quick, no matter what.
it's so dumb to date someone that u work with.
if you both like going to the movies together, then do it.
it's right before fiveplay and just after threeplay.
get a sex toy that you could both have fun with.
ego... its a guy thing lol
ur right udaman, gl!
i realy like him but i dont wanna push him away
i'm not thinking bout him, but i've been having dreams bout him.
probs not.. until he finds another gf.
you gotta get back in the game!
don't do anything you'll regret later!
chat on email and phone to keep internet dating safe.
yeah i did that and it was fun.
cheap ideas are everywhere. find which one works best for you.
you're probably done looking over the men that sees the world in you.
you'll find the right one.
you know it's real love if you can fart when you're around each other.
hope you get the chance to check it out sometime soon.
just walk up to her and say hey.
well i dunno your age (that would help!)
yeah, it is not healthy to do
there is no room for crazy monsters like him in society!!
do you mean seems more sexual?
this is question unfair?
that's like saying, "what can they say after the fact?"
you can save money by choosing certain dates.
i have no further comments on the issue.
why do guys have a hard time saying "love?"
if she loves you she should be fine with it
he asked if i can come with you
a lot of guys just want sex
its bc of a back spasm.
guys need to take r last names.
don't lose your friends bc of some stupid guy.
if he's into u, you'll just know
so glad they r up to the challenge.
put her favorite songs on cd.
i just want to be happy.
dont try to fuck
i feel embarassed when i fall in love
wait for u to be ready
u are too special for them
so, should i take it that he's into me?
i think a guy should take the first step in the dating game.
if i had my way, i would have kept my maiden name.
cut that negativity out of your life and don't look back.
try checking on how he's doing.
try new things to meet new peeps.
it's bs that my cousin likes her cuz i still got feelings.
it worked, i'm convinced.
do hugging, gifts, and fun for vday
not for any other thing but looks
they had no chance
i think they both are interested in me
itty bitty women is hwat they like.
remember to choose and vote for the best.
hubby and i have been together 4 years and just got maried in december 2005.
navy pier and a museums are cool to visit-theres a couple resttaurants and hotels,too.
on of them cwill cheat eventually
i dont think of my self like that. dont worry
my mom makes her trips with pat@alanatvl.com
its over six months. i cant move on
she should move to ma
it doesnt matter. i can handle this
some girls want gifts that last forever
she is strong and loving, but not happy
yuh are young if yuh are interested in sixth graders
size, shape, looks, and othuh surface features should not mattuh at all
yuh are askin' what deir stance is about gay relashunships, or what?
i agree, kiss him, and he will have a response fawh yuh
he gave me his cellphone so i could put my numbuh in it
if you want to have some fun here, i would suggest scoping out the clubs, restaurants, or gyms.
based on that, i would say that that they work it out, but not often, so hope i managed to help.
if you're ever down in fl, hit me up!
just go ask her if she wants to go on a date with you.
sorry, but idk. i still wish you the best.
hi i really want to visit your country
look for another sexy chick and she will become jealous
girl please don't even ask that question unless you want to get mad.
she knew i like him so i don't know now
he's always poppin his eys,why?
try 4play to slow the roll
black hair makes fair skin gals look pale
at first i wasnt going to let her win.
do not tell her that she's fat.
wanna hear a terrible joke?
it would be that way if you didnt play the guilt trip.
he is out playing while you've been gone.
who wouldn't say yes?
not everyone can be themselves together
men don't do no better
i never dated him again
probably since u are the hottest theyve seen
youve found your true love and you need to be with them
you dont need to prove3 it if hes worht it
youre too young to talk about kissing
well all you gotta do is order 1 online an uh the stork it's all magical its gon brang you 1.
it's so much harder as time passes up.
all you gotta do is do you an find somebody else!
how old is they?
all you need to do now is smile!!! :) :)
bottom line is that you gotta stop talking to him and thinking about him
girls that whine about not having flowers are just ungrateful.
i'm laughin cuz that's why i'm single!!
females that are pretty or have good personality
i hate girls.
you should refuse to ever see your cousin or boyfriend.
i don't remember ever giving a girl a christmas present unless i like her.
who can tell if euro women feel more hot sexually?
i was at a carnival when i met mine.
i have no doubt that my husband likes me for who i am.
i know her, she doesn't lie.
if they don't make up their minds soon, we start moving.
what flowers and arrangement u like more
if he doesnt mind, what does it matter
u are too good for him
she's okay with me being dorky.
wedding, lime green, summer event.
what can i do you for?
it'll happen when it's meant to happen.
how u look isnt improtant unless u r trying to prove something
tell the truth. i can take it
start the day with breakfast and a walk
i had an oops and deleted my buddy, he was pissed.
no sex allowed!!!
break the news kindly
up to you when u kiss
ask and shut up
im sure she loves u. youre a good dude
text her back when she calls
thats not right you are wasting you health and girls dont like it
ask someone you like out for valentines
tell her you miss and love her
u just have to keep asking if nothing happens
some ppl just dont have it
theres noooooo way he's gonna say no
ooh yeah george clooney - nice pic lol
my partner wants me to look different
those words are cocky, im much more handsom
bad teeth, breath, and bo
nothing you can say will make it better
everyone would be happier if men understood women
omg you really want to suck another guys d**k?
its better if your not married
as a guy i dont have to pay
yeah he can wear my pants lol hes just gotta ask
what does it matter if it is a rebound relationship for you both?
i wish you luck in your search for "the one".
why is it that everyone seems to want someone that they can not have and know that they should not want?
are you someone who enjoys arguing and fighting?
if you are set on that, then that is the way to go.
i dated someone for 3 years and they cheated on me.
work on your relationship, but do not let him keep you locked up at home.
ask him how he is once in a while.
men get bored before women do.
she is strong and loving and most of all really was not as happy as she seemed to be.
it is one way of saying that you do not like them.
king had a song about this:"only your mother loves you (and she might be jiving, too)".
he loves you too and time will tell.
he wants me to change how i look.
i know i have someone, to whom i come home.
did it feel good? because i want to have sex, but you have to be careful.
you want all of your friendships to last forever?
it does not mean that you are loose.
i am going to a club and dancing.
do not go anywhere you went with him or her.
they are tons of fun and plenty to do.
it depends on when you are ready.
stay 100 miles away from the man.
be prepared, because if it happens once, it can happen again.
i am looking for a girl who wants to spend time with me.
he will get another girlfriend.
my wife does not like to wear those brands.
you should break up and keep yourself open to other options.
why do homosexuals look to marriage?
avoid being weak by not saying sorry for something you did not do.
take time to decide.
they do not respect your feelings.
no, seriously, think about the number of arrogant girls that are out there.
she is too scared to ask him to go out.
get a hold of yourself, how could you love a person that you do not even speak to?
i would ask you to go out, but i live in oregon and i have no idea where you live.
they have not performed previously and the pleasure is twice as nice!
i will most likely go and see.
ether way, i wish you the best, and i am happy that i have brown hair.
send me a picture of you, and i will let you know.
it is just a challenge.
i am a girl, so i can give you some advice.
don't tell them but let them find out once you are in bed with her.
if i would've kept my last name its just freakin name.
i hardly ever see him in school. i usually see him with my brothers playing basketball.
he is telling that to some girls too because he is a womanizer.
you need to leave him; there are plenty of people to find while looking for love.
i am aware because i am just like your wife.
when she calls you, send her a text message back.
no chance, i am five feet four inches tall and he is six feet two inches tall.
do you not know that the number one rule is to trust no one?
we have tried breaking up a couple of times but it never happens.
oh and some because they are thin and skinny, and these days anorexic girls are a turn on.
if you have a penis then it is no problem; you just have to penetrate her vagina with your erect penis.
in that case, take some self defense classes.
i just got out of a three year relationship with my baby's father.
what happened when the politician took viagra?
hello, my name is "xxxxxx" and it has been working for me for years.
i am only able to say that women are complicated.
we like a soft approach and a little bit of pursuing.
you really would be surprised by the types of people who go to them.
when you meet each other after texting for a few months, it can be very enjoyable.
hello, i am in new york city, i will help you out if you are available.
it sounds strange, but it worked for me, in about three to five days.
do not worry, i am not working with much either.
if they do not get along, then they should not spend time together. why does it matter what they think?
if he is, then you have a good man.
if he likes you, you will know it!
i guess it is normal but i would just move on.
the rest is easy from there.
i like any guy that has a sense of humor.
you are the only one who can make this decision.
why did you ask this question?
don't just spill everything because you think it is right.
a ten year age gap is nice.
if he still does not enjoy your company, move on.
okay, i see him every week in psr, but i just cannot speak to him!
because they do not fell secure with uneducated men...
for one thing, if it does not work out, you lose your employment.
i hope to the creator it does not ever pass!
only the ones that are not worth your time.
smaller of course and it is all about attractiveness.
you all do not have any excuse to dislike each other.
if you do not you will always wonder.
some people choose not to because of their religion and others do not.
give it a chance because if you break up with them it will be harder to be friends.
i wish you the best of luck.
that was men who were not ready to commit.
this is a big day for both of you, don't be so rash in you decisions.
i am 55 years old, and am still living with my mother, why is that wrong?
i have a man willing to move 1400 miles to be with me.
i must not be hideous then.
that is okay, i am generous.
it depends on the woman and what she wants.
remember that it takes two, not only one.
if he really liked you instead of her, he would have broken-up with her to be with you already.
stay around until the bar closes, or visit a prison.
please do not miss out on this one.
because, believe it or not, women dislike men with big egos.
you should stick with what you feel inside.
sadly it happened to me twice.
i do not know, perhaps you are young.
regardless of what he says, actions speak louder than words.
there is nothing in the world like an obese woman.
do not sell yourself, even if he is wealthy.
i am a thirty-year-old homosexual man who recently moved to sacramento.
the people who are near you now, such as your friends, should like you no matter what.
because they like the small breasts and genitalia.
you should wait until you are both older and if you still feel the same way then pursue it.
yes, although i am not one of those persons, i do know that there are a lot of them.
no, not if you need to ask.
you want to have oral sex with another man?
because they are girls and they are less sophisticated than we are.
does this mean that he is interested in me?
don't worry about him, concentrate on your classes, and you boyfriend.
i dated someone like this, so i understand.
see the way that she walks.
no (at least i am hoping not).
hello, i desire to visit your country.
over time, should i allow him another chance?
the same man you desire to be in a relationship with?
i went and he was there.
why did you call it that?
that way you can still go by your last name.
both of you have to work hard to get it correct.
i did tell her that i like her and she said that she liked me also.
you can join a community website with live chat and webcam chat.
show her your nude infant photographs.
it is very important to last between thirty and forty-five minutes.
but i am telling you to be celibate until then.
if he is flirting with her, then attack him.
i love curly hair. i like to run my fingers through it.
i want my wife to grow up, too.
well, that is the way it is, i suppose.
one girl, michelle, who likely would not mind being named, spot up and said she did not believe in it.
i can toss him to side and forget about him like last night's trash.
however, he was a little busy afterward.
she knows how much i care about him, so i do not know what to do.
just quit if you do eat something like that.
it could be that you need to use the restroom, or perhaps the last dream you had was the cause.
you know, if he wants to wear my pants, then all he has to do is ask me. sheesh!
if you were friends before and have stronger feelings now, then it should be okay.
i want to try again.
figure out what style of arrangement you would like and flowers.
lie, and then lie some more.
wait until you find out and confirm, then go from there.
if you two are at dance class, it shouldn't matter.
trust him, and don't bring the topic up again.
most women are waiting for a man to tell her what he truly feels.
i would love to meet more women.
i actually think about this occasionally.
i became acquainted with a gentleman one time, romance galore. we first met amidst this incredible rainstorm.
all right, presently certain men like women of that type and others, not as much.
it takes place subsequent to "threeplay" and prior to "fiveplay."
on occasion i'm in a romance with someone, i suffer embarrassment.
should a query be required, the message is that i've not fallen in love.
if you feel it comming on, start the foreplay again.
i do not understand. can someone please give me the answer?
it was no hastle to save 500/600$ doing my own flowers.
i got divorced, and so did he.
ask a woman about the symptoms, because i am male.
women enjoy a little toughness, or most of them do. but mostly, be yourself.
follow your heart because it is never wrong.
they bother you all day.
see if he calls, or if he emails you to see if he cares.
you can perform a citizen's arrest.
usually a back spasm.
by now, you may love your wife for everything the two of you have endured.
good luck. i hope everything goes well.
say, "i love you" and if they hesitate to say it back, that says everything.
attempt once again to invite her on a date and evaluate her response.
no method exists for forcing a person to feel romantically towards you.
pose queries to her (avoid simply conversing).
upon iniitially discovering romantic love, you feel elated, delighted, and joyful simply ruminating on that individual.
also, don't forget that an excess of just one exists!
i personally think that they look better than a lot of the other nations out there.
we we remarried.

to me, it really doesn't matter but a hand full is white enough for me.
choose the one that adores you the most.
you still released at least one thousand.
you visit a bar and drink until you are inebriated.
give it time and thought.
no, you shouldn't leave them, just teach them how to better please you.
bembie reached the proper conclusion.
no, you two should kiss when you are ready.
jules sac is funny but he is mean also.
if you are asking this, then you must have already distanced yourself from her and remained her friend at the same time.

do not attempt to figure it out, that is just the way that it is.
i do not know, but i have knowledge of another webpage that i visit..
okay, it depends on how deeply you are starting to experience emotions for this boy!
he has to be very controlling.
it all depends on how interested the girl is in getting with the man in question.
try and go outside to meet new people.
usually it is more than just one thing.
that is if you truly adore them.
men: do you prefer a larger or a smaller woman?
if your only interaction is argumentative, it is not worth it.
the worst part is, i already dated him for four years.
you simply must be patient and the correct young woman will arrive.
unless you do not love your husband any longer and have room in your life for another man.
wife, because then you can do more without committing a sin.
she does want you to think she is attractive, but she does not want that to be the most important reason.
it depends. some days i want to have intercourse, others i do not.
also, they are more passionate during intercourse.
if you play with both at the same time, she will probably give you great sex.
it is because he would not work, hit me, used guilt trips on me, was a big mama's boy, and so on.
maybe it is because you are the most beautiful girl they have ever seen.
it really depends on whether someone is vain or not.
i want someone i can be myself with.
can you send me a picture of you and contact me?
you need to stay away from your guy friend.
the doctor does not believe it.
i do not like it when she throws up.
if not, don't concern yourself.
i could assist you with some details.
if it feels as if your love is fading, don't ignore it.
i will not be in a relationship with an individual i do not have confidence in.
i only told a woman that i loved her once, and i meant it.
you married him for a reason.
tear your shirt off and yell as tarzan does.
yes, woman down there, do not have intercourse.
they accept this in their culture.
always go trail riding with company.
you didn't give us very useful information, where do all of you live?
move on, who cares if he is attractive.
you just need to be yourself.
yes, you should be disappointed and exasperated.
i apologize, but i have never felt that way.
i sure would not like any woman who would make my life difficult.
if he gets them first, then you get the popcorn.
let's practice. ask me if i am doing good.
if you are sure, however, then you should tell your parents is you have not already done so.
i met mine in a carnival.
are you posing a rhetorical question?
i am of the opinion that everyone should keep their own name.
your first kiss, however, should be heavenly.
nothing good will happen at that place.
here is the best way to make a woman happy.
my advice is to not do things that can allow you to get hurt.
you will absolutely make more money if you work hard.
please do not approach her and tell her how nice she looks.
i do not think it is a good idea, because you are not there for that purpose.
ask her if she is single.
he would make a great valentine.
be ready to let her go.
do not sit there and wait untill he realizes that you are a good one.
just tell them. what are they going to do? slap you?
get a massage, and get away from it all.

you might be overlooking the type of men who like you.
you should find someone who does not hate you.

when will people in this deranged world realize this?
i would not bother with calling him back.
attempt to avoid him and find another man.
search for another attractive woman in order to make her jealous.
in my opinion, you are not promiscuous.
red stands for love, black stands for death, and so on.
if she likes him then she does not like you so let her go because it is not his fault that she strays.
for me, i could start to forget about you once three days have passed.
find a talented girl who is also pretty.
there is no one you can trust more than a good friend.
begin the day with breakfast, then perhaps a nice walk.
pick then up then, is she yes.
if the answer is ye, then why do i hear many girl stating flowers will not last?
it may be that it is interesting for them.

in a family life, this is the most beautiful.
it is your choice not to dislike one, i despise them all, to say the least.
never get married without a prenuptial agreement.
get a life and do not waste mine.
is she saying you are too good for her?
guys will come and go, but friends will be friends forever.
it could mean a variety of things.
yes, it is normal. there are plenty of people who are still attracted to someone they broke up with.
i would like to see what a black female has to say about this.
men are stupid! who knows why they do what they do?
well, you do not have to wait at all, if they give you their phone number.
because we are all masters of the universe.
i am in love and do not care who knows it.
do not try to have both of them at once, whatever you do.
you would not be asking if you really wanted to be with him.
it is ok to be friends with someone online, but there should be limits.
my sister closes her eyes to get ready when she kisses someone.
i personally would not marry a woman who did not want to change her name, but that is just me.
just a small party for the family.
girls are perverts; they just hide it and act like perverts around other girls secretly.
and i am only in fifth grade.
you do what you want.
refrain from that course of action, it will not be successful.
should they fail to do so, the moment has arrived to continue apace.
he possessed all the qualities i desired, with his attractiveness, wealth, and other factors.
correct, also it is a portender of misfortune to glimpse the betrothed at the marriage ceremony.
no, she is not a liar.
be quiet and be a homosexual if you choose to.
he also had his nose pierced.
yes, i can lift him, he only weights 185 pounds.

i find it unattractive if she is so drunk she becomes loose.
exchange letters, e-mails, chat online or over the phone, send packages, just keep in touch!
most definitely on those occasions when you have no desire to do so.
he dribbles, shoots, and scores: two points.
sacrificing it simply to maintain his presence in your life is akin to making a deal with the devil for your immortal soul.
i'm unable to offer a wife-based opinion, however, i'm hoping my assessment is equally valuable.
and it eases the pressure i'm feeling to invite somebody.
it is the woman's decision.
ask in english, no one here understands you.
i am a man, and i can give you some insight.
i like him so much, and i want to be with him.
i like this man very much, and i do not know if he feels the same way.
by the way, your avatar looks familiar.
it has been more than six months, and i cannot seem to get over it.
perhaps he believes that he will be denied; just ask him, which is what i would do.
i suggest that you consider that point, and it should be helpful in determining whether you can trust him.
a picture of the two of you, the shape of a heart, from when you were first dating. that is special.
i am in college, and he is my only source of income until i graduate.
it isn't so easy. i got together with my ex-boyfriend in second grade, then in fourth grade, and again in eighth grade.
i have been in a relationship with this girl for 8 months, and we have not yet kissed. is this bad?
some men aren't at all attracted to breasts.
she only wants to see other people?
we have seen each other, everyday, for approximately four to five years.
that was his destination, so he got off of the train.
the worst that could happen is that she says no.
i know what i want in a relationship.
he might ask you on a date if you flirt, and send flowers and candies to myself.
i do not like seeing my dad unhappy.
i feel bad because i know that i snore sometimes. most people do, right?
i like s.o.s and need to know if i'm in love.
if you guys truly love each other then you can work out all the fighting.
because neither of you have the guts to call it quits.

but he is getting married this month.
but those guys are mean and you do not want them anyway.
say will you go out with me?
and get married only after you have been with a guy for more than 2 years.
men have a penis and women have a clitoris.
separate the bad thing and move on.
it would be easier to do if i were furious.
if she tells the administration i will be expelled because it is pakistan, not america.
you should get to know her and eventually you or her will ask each other out.
as i said, he already knows you like him, so just take a deep breath and ask him.
perhaps you and i can get together some time and we will fall in love with each other.
i would be, but i just got married!
play the field for a bit right now.
i agree with everyone else, don't marry too early.
have you been to the doctor yet?
pay attention to what everyone else is saying.
just talk to your spouse about this.
if you are into sixth graders you are obviously young.
i was thinking about picking a medium pink color, but what should it go with?
ask if they want to go somewhere with you.
a trip to a amusement park such as a roller coaster or even a theatrical museum are fun.
do men truly prefer bigger women?
the problem is that i truly like him.
i would say they do work out, not a of the times, but i hope this helps.
should i break up with him because of his mother?
i did it before, accidentally, and my friend was mad that i deleted him.
i do not believe i mind, either way.
that is her way. you could try it that way or you could keep your eyes open.
some do that, but you should be able to tell.
are you talking about your avatar?
i do not remember giving a woman a christmas gift, unless i liked her.
i do not know what to do.
try to be yourself and do not show off.
just take it day-by-day and step-by step to figure out how he lost a good thing.
the world would be happier if men knew what women want.

i think she will hurt him.
it means she is interested in the guy.
i am thinking you might get harmed.
we are now only just divorced.
if the suggest a salacious photo, they would like to have intercourse.
at least she didn't give you a fake number.
tell her to move to massachusetts.
you should not get married if you feel this strongly about it.
i would pick maui or the bahamas.
the guy that i like is mad at me.
do not worry, you are only 13.
try this which will result in you not worrying about the appropriate amount of calls to him.
as a guy, i can say, we men love to chase women.
thanks for the talk.
we tend to push away the ones that we love.
they believe that they can control the lives of others when they cannot.
that is strange but i do not know. i will talk with my friend by his locker.
i do not know. how would you like to have something pushed up your anus?
if a man cares, then he calls.
what is a special gift i can give to my brother-in-law on his birthday?
he probably isn't interested either.
hold her hands, look in to her eyes, and tell her everything you've wanted to say.
some men do, and some men do not.
i would very much like to know, so please help me.
the timing was not right with the former man, you will see.
generally kind and my fifth. i will only be disappointed if she is unintelligent.
it is one of the presents which we can always give ourselves.
i do not believe that trust needs to be earned because how is that even possible to do?
if that is you, then you definitely need to stop because it is nasty.
do not let her rule your life, she will need to learn how to cope with it.
i have yahoo email and that works fine for me.
i would not worry too much about that.
yes, that trickster has never had a chance.
it is a good sign when you can fart in front of the person you are dating.
that depends on the person's age.
any man who says he would, is likely not being entirely honest with himself.
if you flirt with him, the challenge is not there.
if you need your ex emotionally, then you may have some issues.
she should be 20 to 32. she does not have to be younger than you.
maybe she does not love you, but try to use your brain and not your heart.
do not let her know that want to be with her forever and you probably stand a better chance of that being the way that it is.
there a lot of inexpensive ideas out there, you need to find what you like and work with it.
if you are worried about it performance wise, you should not.
find another girl if that does not work, move back
almost without exception (not constantly) those are men similar in age to yourself, more or less.
if your behavior is always as it is now, she may come to believe you're in a state of desperation.
not every participant present is attending educational courses.
advise him of your genuine desires. that's the information relayed, but an action not attempted. make comments.
shall i take the initial action or shall i bide my time until he takes the initial action?
you have set up a double standard.
after a while, you do not see the color.
i am trying to get the nerve to ask her on a date.
if you two are serious, then if you ask her that question, if should not bother her.
why do you want to ask her out?
would you like to go on a date with me?
let me know if you are ever in flordia.
those were some wonderful times.
it is all about her, and that isn't what should happen on a first date.
do you really want to get married to someone you constantly argue with?
if he has come to his senses, then that is wonderful.
you are too good for them.
get the upper hand because she like him.
depending on the age, compact disc or digital video discs.
start from the beginning and then work your way to 20 years down the road.
i would like to visit the united states. what are important items to bring?
anyone who has any ideas, tips, or general information, please send me an e-mail.
you sound live a very lovely person, so do not allow these women to make you feel bad.
you do not search. go outside, enjoy yourself, and a girlfriend will come along.
do not pursue it. he is getting married.
is it like clear liquid that turns yellow when it dries?
if the country you are in has a short messaging system in your cellphone then find a texting friend.
when she starts closing her eyes, kiss her on the lips and then it is up to you.

have fun and remember to never get so comfortable that you always know what is going to happen next.
it demonstrates how much they care about you.
let her know that you miss her and love her.
coffee; lunch; site-seeing; walk, talk or play in the park; visit a museum; go to a movie matinee.
what you want is a prostitute. you can locate one in any part of the world.
however, now we do all of these activities together and i do not know what to do.
because if it fails, you will be in trouble.
and it has been the best thing for me.
try using these, but only if they apply!
the problem is that he recently cheated, and it was very damaging.
if you are happy, she should be happy. unless she is toxic to the relationship.
we like when men do things for us and think about us.
perhaps if you allow him to be alone for a time, then he will call you back.
tell him that you do not want a real relationship.
if you are strange-looking and you stare, then they will think you are leering.
i don't know if he loves you, but i am positive he is interested in you.
if a man really respects you, he will understand you.
reflect on you actions and then decide. if you are capable of affording it, do what you would like.
he is the only superhero that is relatable to an average joe.
sometimes a little struggle is worth it in the end. the good will always outweigh the bad.
i do not think that it is wise to date people that you work with.
dunce, you need a theory class for that.
let it take its course from there.
i asked them what they think about gay marriage and relationships.
of course, i had to ask him if he was ignoring me.
men will believe you to be attractive no matter what, usually.
but i do not believe that he will be unfaithful or leave you due to lack of intercourse.
the safest rules of internet dating are to chat via email, messenger, and phone.
marriage is about trust and communication.
i also had this problem.
it depends on who you kissed.
it depends on whether you can trust him at all.
just get your point across to her and make sure that you do not make her abhor you.
where have you been meeting these women from the philippines.
try to imagine that it was considered love.
that way you aren't exactly telling them what you specifically don't like about them.
if he is then go for it.
see if she's open for a dinner and a movie.
hey, i'm sorry. i don't know and i wish the best of luck to both of you.
however, i find him looking at me every now and then.
we have started our own sins.
for me, fun includes eating meals.
make a nice move, and if there is no responce, she is not interested.
let him make the first move, because if you do it might look like you are obsessed with him.
you should not get married.
my tragic love story was that we both loved each other very much.
you seem desperate, and you will never find one if you are desperate.
but he swears that we are merely friends.
appearance is not important unless you are attempting to prove something.
i realize that once you have sex with him, he no longer remains a good friend.
from my perspective, when a man is very self centered, i find that it makes him far less appealing.
you should take your time and feel all your emotions come to life.
it is a two way street; until you get them, you will know which one it is.
you have one child out of wedlock.
i realize i am overly selective when it comes to people; how can i stop this?
it hurts a good deal; perhaps some young women might say that is it?
i am going to surprise that young man; is that the correct choice?
it was a good idea.
if she gets drunk, then it is not a turn off.
some women send men minuscule messages without saying it clearly.
i would prefer if they left me alone. i apologize for going off topic.
ask her to go do something she is interested in, or see a movie she would like.
i use the term "man" very lightly when describing you.
it is too bad that it is not automatic such as msn or aol are.
that is how they will react to it, so yes it is a bad situation for you both.
you should go back to that person as soon as you can, before it becomes too late.
i also would like to slap that smile off of her face.
ask him if he would like to dance with you.
she might say that a different color looks better.
ask him to see a doctor.
i never went on a second date with him.
why did you break up?
go ahead and do it.
if he does not mind, no one elses opinion matters.
i am still in love with him.
i do not want to have sex again.
the most important issue, is not attempt to retaliate at the individual that wronged you.
if it's necessary to question other people, i do not believe that your ready.
i'm a female, i state things such as that.
a great savings area are flowers.
time will tell. in six months, we'll see what occurs.
you may be the only one with whom he can have sex.
from the list you have provided, i would select spiderman.
i was the victim of cheating for three of those years.
it seems that all of the male senior students think that freshmen girls are promiscuous, which unfortunate.
if he say's yes then you can tell him.
impress her with affection and love.
if you have, what was it like?
celebrate valentines day with joy and fun, give each other gifts and have fun.
any women sitting next to the beastly men, will be salacious.
when i moved in, my neighbor asked me out.
he is obviously shy, perhaps you should make a move.
on a much harsher scale as time goes on.
be yourself and say, "what is up?" you just might get a response.
many times you have loved a man, but were not sure if he loved you back.
if you are talking about a husband, or something similar, then i would say tools, toys for his vehicle, and sports related things.
that really stimulated me sexually, but i ran away.
as for me, i will pick up the tab if i can get your vote for "best answer".
alright, so what do you think is the most desirable breast size according to the average male?
many women 22-years-old date men that are 27. so, the 22-year-old man feels insecure and have to fish downstream.
lust is less than like. did you recently go out?
they likely know you cannot hide that bug you should tell you parents.
i will make you a princess on the planet krypton.
my last girlfriend's boyfriend did that to her, before we met. she still kept dating him.
my friend is in a relationship with someone online.
do you enjoy fake nails or manicured ones?
tell her, women enjoy hearing the truth. best of luck to you.
we can wrestle and be best friends.
you need to remain faithful to your husband. he is the one the you swore vows to.
do not listen to these fools with all of their nonsense.
yes i am a male, therefore i do not really have to pay.
remember, no bird ever flew on only one wing.
just let her know how you feel.
it can depend; if you really love him then you may think that you want to elongate it.
if you or the other person are married, you need to quickly leave.
no, men do not however little boys do.
please help me to win this debate with her.
my girlfriend it very silly but i love her anyway.
simple enough, play with it, like everyone else does.
sweetheart, let him go, and if he is meant to be with you, he will come back to you.
of course, my back went out after the third straight day of that.
stay alive, and try to get your old life back.
that is why i asked why men don't know what they want in a relationship?
maybe ask him out for lunch or a movie?
girls don't like boys who only think of themselves.
do you like either of them?
i was always looking. i kept choosing men that were not kind.
no, i feel it is a choice. one does what one feels comfortable to them.
some do, some do not have it in them.
do what makes you happy.
for some reason, i cannot.
so it would have to be love.
because you know to try and search for your love, but be careful.
do not ask her to perform some act for you; make her the spotlight instead.
girls are simply impressed if you can show a little care, respect, and honesty to them.
tell the bad man to leave.
they think it is the only correct way.
i hope you stay calm and wish you luck.
you need to decide for yourself if you want to stay married to him.
i dislike him because of the way he acted.
if you do not obey men like this, they typically become the sort who beat their wives.
i have four children. a homemaker is more work than my occupation even.
no, i haven't. i prefer average looking men.
it definitely appears as if he has feelings for you. do you show him how you feel?
people overall make their decisions quickly currently.
i have a issue with unloading all my past in the beginning. perhaps, i imparted too much on him.
the right date can save money on many things.
if you truly love your boyfriend and want it to work it out, then tell your ex boyfriend to respect that.
it only makes her easier to seduce.
i do not think you should attempt it.
honesty and love, and try to be honest with them.
i was hoping for at least a 90%, but realistically, i think it was more like 70% or 65%.
cuddling with a large woman is one of the best feelings i know.
women also expect men to act like that, so why should they grow up?
it happens a couple of ways. get him drunk.
the problem is not if you ask her while at work or not.
stick with the boys who are either thirteen or fourteen.
do not let a man mistreat you.
i do not like having stay at home "romantic dinners."
when i left him, i promiced myself i would never get married again.
to not use pick up lines, just be yourself and compliment her.
you will be fine, have fun.
some men shave, it depends on the woman.
i still love him, but i believe that i am ready to move on and meet new men.
wait for another four years.
i hope that i see some of it very soon.
i do not want to be mean.
also, you should wait awhile before having children.
i would like to have some fun with you. that is why i answered the question.
try to contact their question and answer team. they will help you through, have a nice day.
women are not easy to get into bed.
if he insists, it means he is only after sex.
it definitely matters. anyone saying they do not, is likely lying.
while having intercourse is similar to a fantasy.
when you are eighteen or twenty years old, because when they said something, they did not mean it.
try to make it yourself whenever possible.
but, because there is always an exception, is there not?
if she is no longer interested in you.
i really doubt that you are in love with all of those men.
on average, i would say about 45 percent at first, but it is perhaps 15 percent once you get to know the person.
play sports with your male friends.
she will tell you if it is not okay with her.
i am not asking whether you think women are sexy and beautiful.
how do i get him to stop nagging me and leave me alone?
try a sex toy, that way, you both can enjoy it.
men without hari look like itttle boys, it is not attractive to me.
if you kiss him, her will respong one way or the other.
can you imagine yourself without him/her?
here, in america, it is not so important.
well, obviously, if it was before you, then he was not cheating at all.
i wonder how many times i passed up a great opportunity by worrying that someone would say, "no."
the caucasian women are taking up all the men.
also, your self-image is very important.
have you had a pap smear?
how old are you?
i think they both like me.
it sounds like you two are already married.
jamie is going to ask rubi out on a date.
that is a signal. such things can make it very obvious.
you should take time to get to know them both equally without going on dates with them.
i would appreciate logical opinions on this. thank you.
if you are interested in the man, then attempt it.
enjoying yourself with male friends is fine.
so, it is natural with that man.
women take on very much and at times, they feel like they do it for no reason.
no, because i am not yet married.
let me know what your thoughts are, thank you.
if you are gay then be gay!
good luck and hang tight.
i think it is wrong that they cannot go out with her.
what does everyone think?
i met my last boyfriend while i was driving in a roundabout.
because if you do, you are going to lose your friend over a man!
it was really casual with i said it, i did not think he would remember.
are you a country girl or a city girl?
spend the day together, and to top it off touch his feet.
i am bored of being single. i can only sit back any watch as other girls have all the fun!
women, including myself, are curious about sex with other women.
i was too lazy to read your typing, so i do not know what it was that you said.
i dislike it myself; i love the straight ones.
i am doctor izzy. i love and adore larger women.
there are no words that will make it better.
do it before it is too late.
honestly, you will learn but you must actually do it.
navy pier is a good place or one of the museums. there are many good restaurants or hotels.
i am not a country girl by the way but that is a stereotype and i think i am sexy in my own way.
he will not turn you down.
well, i hope you read this very well.
lots of men, especially black men, like women who are slightly heavy.
if she is interested she will call later
no you will not because you know he has a tendency to cheat.
as yourself that if you know what i mean.
i find if i try really hard, i can see things that i know are not normally there.
how about we get some coffee, chat and take it from there.
just move on with your life and find someone else.
i will bet you are not, but if you try to email me at thickchix@yahoo.com i will be honest.
me and this man have been dating on and off since last year.
i really care about you and i cannot stop thinking about you.
it is worth the wait when you are ready.
if you do not know you should ask someone who would.
repel your fear and inform him.
that is a risk you will have to take.
therefore, if you want to be attractive to people who are unsuccessful, strange, and perverse then you ought to drink heavily.
not for anything other than the appearance.
even though time has passed, i still love him.
it is your own life, make your own decisions.
even though i am getting divorced, i am still stuck with this.
just because he has potential to be a decent boyfriend, does not mean that he will be.
of course, let me get to know you more.
one minuite you might be fighting, the other you might feel passion for them.
i like girls that are pretty or have a great personality.
people whose parents take care of them are lazy.
i do not know what she wants.
it is complicated. can you tell me in a simple way?
show her what you are good at.
can you imagine him as the father of your children?
if you do not ask, someone else just might.
that is why i am single.
if you really loved him you would let him go.
if she does not want to be with you, try to be her friend.
if he says he is not, believe him.
let us get it out of limbo.

i have to stop myself right now, because i am ready to relieve myself.
whatever you decide, do not tell him too soon!
we cannot answer if she really means it.
i do not like a guy that does that all of the time.
then you can make an easier decision.
i have had sexual intercourse with many girls, and some of them were whores.
he dribbles, shoots, and scores 2 points.
talk to your best friend and see if it is cool.
is this a trick question?
i do not know; can i do anything about it?
people are husbands and wives for reasons!
if he doesn't, then there are too many fish in the sea.
or do you just want to say that?
if you are not happy then you need to fix it or leave.
not all men, however some men do.
i completely agree with'udaman", best of luck.
you seem to try too hard for others approval.
your girlfriend will only think that you are being a jerk.
occasionally, but you have to observe your significant other.
are you replaying everything that you did to me?
do not sit around waiting for the phone to ring.
a guy that i dated this past year, got to the point of violence.
i do not care what she says, leave it alone, she is in enough pain.

it does not hurt to be dirty.
we were spending a little time together.
do not use pick up lines. that is a turn off.
i love them because i am a man, and i do not have to ask anyone to the dance.
woman, there are other more men that love thick girls out there than you think.
the women that whine about flowers' inability to last are just ungrateful.
you need to be with that person once you have found your true love.
i mean that you have to really be her friend.
how do i get my significant other to show me that he loves me.
basically, you have to stop talking to him and stop thinking about him.
they have never met but she says they are in love.
you have to do this in person and not on the phone or through email.
gay people are some of the best friends a person could have.
i met a girl and i want to know if she likes me or not.
death is like a box-full of candy corn. it gives you cavities.
just try to make the best of what is to come.
you have two choices, you either move on with you life, or you try to make it work with this person.
she is the love of my life and i cannot wait to spend the rest of it with her.
women think with their brains.
i still love my ex, and i am very angry at my cousin because my ex likes her.
only time will tell. spend time with his friends, have fun, and do not think about it.
that is why i do not go to chat rooms anymore, unless it is to have a laugh at those in them.
this is what i did, and i feel i made a mistake in doing so.
i do not know where to begin.
he cheated, however, which i believe means i can lift or carry my husband.
if she is calling just to chat, ask her to call you less frequently.
that is all i have to say.
perhaps you should not be asking this question.
i was also thinking of lime green.
i intended to indicate the both of you together.

they enjoy the challenge. that's what i enjoy about it as well.
it depends upon the women. fair skinned females appear extra pale when they have black hair.
oh, i should do that when i am seeing someone the next time!
do not listen to what any other person tells you to do.
i really am attracted to this man, and i do not know if it is just a phase, or if i have love for him...
i believe the bomb is much more simple!
not always the most simple, but they have been pretty decent years.
don't forget to decide. vote for the best answer.
you need to admit why you're attracted to her.
is he a homosexual, or is it curiosity?
no, not if you need to question.
the list could go on forever.
he might enjoy all of the waiting, dreaming, and teasing.
do not eat where you defecate.

i have friends that get married after 6 months of dating.
i do not understand you.
if you want children, then homemaker.
what is the worst thing that could occur?
intellect. an intelligent woman is attractive.
his/her intelligence, the way they carry themselves, appearance, and activeness.
sure, and are you going to pay mine too?
yes, i do have long black hair and i can say that i am proud.
i was not going to let her win.
chandes are that if you like her as a friend, you will like her as more than a friend.

you are doing so already so why still bother?
on the hood of my car during a light rain at the waterfront; it was amazing.
i believe you're a good man. most likely she loves you quite a bit.
you're looking too hard, or perhaps, searching in the incorrect sites. sign up for yahoo! personals.
if that's want you want.
if she doesn't have a reason, then she isn't your chum!
you need to see discern what's correct for you both.

it sounds as if you are going through a lot right now.
good luck, but do your homework.

some guys think they do not need you until you are gone.
i wish you good luck.
i hope you married your husband because you love him.
i like to express myself through poetry to the women in my life.
why limit yourself to just one man?
that is, if you both agreed to do this.
that is like saying, "what is there to stop me after i have already done it?"
he simply has to start over, and regain your trust again.
the only family member i have met of his was his father.
we fall in love, they treat us badly. why do we keep doing this to ourselves?
i am one that wants to wait, until i am completely in love with someone special.

i suppose it is rather nice. it is like having your father's blessing completely.
i like intelligent, entertaining, and attractive women.
come to my town. i will be your girlfriend.
this is not an intelligent generation.
it is time to cash out.
they lust for each other.
i become happy when i see an advertisement for malaysia air on television.
the way he asked me on a date was very nice.
attempt to converse with her and ask to spend time together as friends and see if it leads anywhere.
this is difficult because there are many temptations.
you do not have to become that just because she says so.
the two of you should talk privately and personally. you have to clarify each other's side, so do it now!
well, the one i enjoyed went like this.
try not to have sex.
just keep it cool. it might help to be a little hard to get!
if your relationship has survived the "four seasons" i suppose that you should be ready.
i married the man i was with anyway, and do you know the reason other than love?

whatever you decide, make it completely yours!
you cannot fix it with her parents. you might be able to sweet talk her friends. but please specify, why?
how intoxicated is she?
women are attracted to confident men.
i am only doing this so that i will receive points.
if you two do not know anything about each other, you will be unable to connect.
if you truly do, i would say that is was a real relationship. best of luck to you.
but really. if you are used to it, and you kind of like it, then go with it.
because it is buy one, take one.
and, last but not least, does he always just happen to be staring?
it sounds like a con, but i am telling you that women enjoy it.
you've only met men with a specific preference.
i have always believed that there is a difference between intercourse, and intimate relations.
you have to distance yourself.
in my case i think it is eighty percent.
leaning towards me and kissing me gently on only the forehead.
i cannot imagine my life without my husband.
i do. it is much more attractive and as smooth as silk.
however, flowers are very nice even if they are not lasting.
it seems that he is enjoying him self overly much while you are away.
what's the explanation for one's inability to pester the young woman?
perhaps you should attempt to pursue young women, given the tendency by men to be offensive.
in addition, i am in possession of no girlfriends whatsoever.
do not forget, "s" is attracted to men who present their true selves to the world, and no one else!
their opinion is they've exceeded the skill level of females, however, they're inorrect.
that fact does not mean that you should let them in your circle.
that thought is always in the back of my mind.
does she have other friends to talk with on the phone?
getting married and having children can wait, but school cannot wait.
you need to do this a few times to get comfortable.
most teen boys prefer girls that like sex.
don't look back and enjoy the friends you have.
if its your personal belief in something its not good or bad.
i don't know what i should do.
yes, it is a stupid habit.
wait until you turn 25 because you will not lose your charm by then.
my best friend dislikes my boyfriend and wishes that i would break up with him, but i will not.
relax and be yourself because that is what we like.
i do not think so. perhaps they should try our last names.
you should both pick either his or yours when you have children.
of course he wants to continue.
i guess i picked a domestic goddess.
try asking her out after class.
live life to the fullest and have faith.
i am a man so i also have feelings.
give him a call.
start with a basic, everyday question and go from there.
you should tell more people.
all that my friends want to do is conjugate.
actual kissing and asking if you are a desirable kisser.
we will not regret being at your service anytime.
you need to replace it, just add it back in, the same way you did the first time.
you can share this with your mother and father.
do not fall for the, "alcoholic only on the weekends," line that guy is giving you.
unless you know him fairly well, you are stinking yourself out there to get hurt.
a & b cups are preferable.
start a friendship first, then let the relationship develop.
don't listen to what people, (not just men), say; watch how they act.
do you feel the same?
however, if a man asks you, do not be afraid to reject him.
obviously, she is not interested in you, if you know she is interested in the other boy.
there are many factors that cause a woman to dislike intercourse.
not all men become bored and move on.
but there is no better person to marry than your best friend.
it depends on what you are searching for, as in friendship only, etc.
i behaved as such in the company of my present romantic partner.
however, it's not defined as you both being unable to have affection for one another.
simply dissolve the marriage. he possesses no valor and he has no feelings for you.
in essence, males simply desire a female romantic partner in order to have sexual relations!
should no action prevail, you must request it of him once more.
keep your personality, do not let any man determine how you behave.
search yourself for this one.
you will not need to if the man is worthy.
i do not like it when she is like that. i am confused, what should i do?
shop around for invitations, and everything else!
he then asked me, "can i come with you?"
act based on your feelings. if you like her that much, then go with it.
i am only myself around guys i do not like. you know how that turns out.
i hope that you find a nice girl to date.
i have liked one girl since i was in 9th grade.
hi and hugs to all my fellow girls at cone!
if she likes him, there is a reason.
if going to a movie is special for the two of you, do that.
it seems as though you are in charge.
have you told her it irritates you to have her check on you every day?
for the same reason thin women prefer slender, toned men.
he handed me his cellular phone, and had me input my phone number.
go to hawaii, or pay someone.
i do not understand why people think it is wrong.
keep searching for a believer in romance. she is out there!
you are not a good person of you plan to be unfaithful to your wife.
he knows that you like him, has he said anything bad about it?
the only way you will know is if you confront him and ask him directly.
that is more of a trust issue.
never give up trying to impress her.
you are being punished, so you don't get to watch tv for a month.
i think this is better than my personal life.
that doesn't bother me, i just said that we are only friends.
go to school. you can still come home or call your family or friends.
go with the one that picks on you, because nine times out of ten, he likes you.
i always felt the same way, however, i met my true love and my views changed.
take a bath? do you know how to speak?
i enjoy his company and he says things like, if i were not dating, i would go out with you.
just dispose of him and you will be better off.
this is the one time in your life to really live out the true fantasy of love.
people asked me what the hurry was?
has he ever just broke up with a girl and left before?
i am 36 now and still need therapy for it.
for goodness sakes, do not allow me to be one of those controlling mothers.
did you ever think about that?
it has been half of a year, is it normal for me to still have affection for him?
search for a man that is attractive!
it is really nice and just what you are searching for!
is there a reason that you are not with the infant's father?
no, it is certainly unacceptable. you are simply wasting your health because women simply hate it.
anything larger than a handful, probably a size c or d, is excessive.
in my opinion, they do.
stop attempting to mock everyone with it.
you should look for somewhere in public, where you will feel most comfortable.
a man asked if i would mind cuddling with him.
ask what the score of the last game was.
some couples are never going to be that comfortable with each other.
you should not do anythign that you will regret later.
it would be ok the day after.
you are missing a smile.
the same thing happenned to me.
i do not like girls.
you should be nice, give eye contact, and smile.
i wonder why he shaved his legs.
i wish you luck.
i have heard this many times.
i will go with anything natural, but nothing fake. i despise that word.
i would date someone ten years younger. who wants to date an older woman?
you should ask your best friend if it would be okay to do that.
many people will tell you no when you ask.
there is a lot to do on the weekends in downtown houston.
someone claimed women do not have feelings?
do not be shallow and start with her looks.
move on if they have.
flirt with him and gauge his reaction.
i am waiting until i am married, but when is it too far?
there is nothing wrong with her taking your number.
and you do not need to be an overly-happy, hyper-active person.
i do not want to approach suddenly and ask, "will you go out with me?"
then the enjoyable part happens: him making it up to you.
you have to spend at least 5 minuites on kissing and hugging.
i can not help you unless i have more information.
i say no on avatars.
some girls prefer gifts that will last and not die on them.
he is probably wondering if you are interested in him at all. flirt back.
i feel goofy, dorky and happy.
if you are a hoe then he is one too. i personally don't think you are one though.
so there are some guys that only say the l word if they mean it.
i don't need a trophy, i want a companion.
as a man, let me say this.
be confident and always believe in yourself. do not become arrogant, though. always make good eye-contact and listen to what she has to say.
then he said, "do you want some of my chapstick?"
kissing is something you cannot do wrong or right.
we love them,adn it is not untill later we thing about what we have done.
i do not know. i have the same issue.
what was the mistake that you made?
it is similar to breaking a drug habit.
tell him, and it would not seem crazy because you have known one another for a long time.
good, that girl answered the first question for me.
instead, how about blue and green?
a life of your own. a life that you've been missing out on.
confusing, yes, you're correct.
you don't necessary have to ask her out on a date, to go out with her.
perhaps he will call you.
alright, tell her, but be as polite as possible.
in a park when i was 16, is where i lost my virginity.
what man does like big breasts?
you should be proud of yourself.
men work and fix things, but what can you do?
we do not know what you look like!
what four qualities whould you want in a woman?
you can get plenty of ideas for your wedding from the internet, local newspaper, or news.
it is a turn off if she sits on your best friend's lap when drunk.
see my boyfriend on my 360 profile?
you will find a man who really deserves you one day.
it is you and that sexy perfume that you wear.
if you and him are still not ready, then forget about him.
why do they want it state sanctioned?
and she still lets me play with my trucks and watch cartoons.
you can still love him,but you need to move on.
is he willing to go out of the way for you?
if anyone has the answer, let me know.
i never knew life could be good.
he said he would call me back.
you pick the one you like the most.
you need to take it off.
if you love him, you will tell him.
i would enjoy that being done to me.
what should i do to be successful with her?
you must be controlled and introduce yourself.
there are films that i have yet to see.
i believe it all depends on age and upbringing.
that will just be sexual intercourse.
my partner was absolutely my friend first and it is wonderful!
who has a care for what any other person thinks.
attempting to get some blonde highlights as well.
just let it all out. i use art a lot to vent when i have problems.
if she likes music, make her a special cd or tape.
it could be. choose one and indicate why.
do not worry about what people will say.
i think a lot of girls like getting flowers.
it has nothing to do with being vulnerable, young or submissinve.
you need to let him go or date his brother.
you have to look.
you can get them at staples for thirty-five dollars.
your child is going to have a difficult time growing up without a father.
my friend tells me that i am too nice, and that i should tell him no.
my girlfriend always says she loves me when we are passing notes during class but she doesn't say it face to face.
that's right, the relationship happened on it's own.
you will look like a fool.
no, and you should not care. stay with him if you like him.
i think you should be yourself. have self-esteem and self-confidence.
any item that has not been nailed down!
make it your top priority to see her, if you really want to be with her that badly.
a few months ago, one of my best friends was in a relationship with my older sister.
should i just forget about it and move on?
their friends on the other hand are a different story.
yes i do, i believe that anyone does.
my cousin met up with some weird old pervert saying he was a attractive teen that she met online.
nobody was on my list, so i choose my neighbor's wife.
i have long black hair and love it. my husband loves it too.
you care what happens, and everyone in your family will love you.
unattractive guys take whatever girls they can get.
it happened in the middle of the river while people were watching. it was actually pretty funny!
it is all in the eye contact.
it depends on the guy. some guys do and some do not.
it sort of gives us the impression that you may not have strong guts.
sure, if you love him and he really loves you, but he may not want to disappoint his father.
yes, some men get right down to it with no thought for the woman at all.
perhaps she is not mean and the skinny girl is.
it does sound somewhat feminine.
if you would like to enjoy it a bit, you should check out some restaurants, night clubs or gyms.
there are a lot of good women left, you just need to look in the right places.
the truth is that everyone has to separate one day or another.
you win some, you lose some. take it with a grain of salt, and be more careful next time.
happy birthday, to you.
i need someone to assist me in figuring this out.
pick the one that treats you better.
i am into a 6th grade boy, too.
if you end the relationship, he might not continue to be your friend. that is why i do not date my friends.
stick yourself out there, you have to do a lot more than eye contact.
do what is best for you and him.
bad teeth, breath, and body odor.
no one needs to know that.
if i have to ask then i will leave the relationship and move on with my life.
hey, do not misunderstand me.
i asked him if he still liked me and he said yes, but he did not act like it.
where am i looking to go with this?
as one gets older, keep getting younger and younger men, to make you feel better.
you know that it would be if you did not play,'the guilt trip."
that does not means that it makes it correct, it only means that it makes us human.
it is a mistake that cannot be undone.
practice unwrapping starburst and tying cherry stems, with your tongue.
did you catch her looking at you?
i know three guys that can probably get away with doing something like that.
ask her out or at least tell her that you like and admire her.
if he is going to on and off like that, i say break up with him for good!
if they do not, then you will have to get on with your life.
i have never been.
complement her, ask for her name. do not act weird, act like you have confidence.
she calls him all the time.
how should i approach her and not be just another man hitting on her?
wait a little while and then date because that way you will enjoy it more.
someone who acts calm just because she thinks it is cool, but it is not.
it is because you do not have any power over the decision.
i know, so why should i hide it?
certain men simply have no inclination toward dancing.
sincerely, she shouldn't be considered a compatriot of yours due to her inability to refrain from being an annoyance to you!
my wish is that i had paid attention to the comments from my circle.
how much time must pass before you can decide it consumes too much time and she has no genuine interest?
do i want to be in love?
why do they want to be married?
that is a nice picture of george clooney.
some women fo not find guys their own age attractive.
i would not want a pair that big.
it sounds like you both are comfortable with how things are now.
i think it is beautiful. it looks great on most any woman.
sometimes, it is better to be good friends first, and make sure you are happy around one another.
will i always feel that way?
listen to faith hill's song "love ain't like that". it is a great example.
please, do not ask that question if you do not want your feelings hurt.
your partner should accept that if they truly care about you.
i am attracted to men who shave their legs.
if you are still in communications with each other, i do not think that is the best thing to do.
i am attracted this man, austin, and i told my friend, claudia, to ask him if he adores me also.
you are slaying the romance by popping the obtuse question. ever thought about just enjoying each other, instead?
trust me, he is a player and no good.
it depends, they all adore different ones, but definitely, not ones that are egotistical, aberrations like you happen to be.
i think that is fantastic, perhaps you should make the first move.
if he turns you down, he is not worth it in the first place.
just go up to her.
it is a good idea to always be honest because not many guys are going to dislike being told they are attractive.
they know the women will not chase them unlike good looking men who attract plenty of women.
ask him if he would like to see a movie.
they call it making love.
he will know you like him if you smile at him.
she will answer the question, because most girls are polite.
you sound like my best friend.
ask him when he is taking you to dinner.
i think a lot of guys do not care.
it will work out if you want it to.
do not force him to dance if he does not want to.
the guy should make the first move.
without being in a relationship, that might appear to be a little promiscuous.
wait and take it from a military woman.
you never know, they only show affection when they want something.
i am 49 years old. i am looking for a beautiful woman to spend my time with and possibly more.
did you mean, "seems more provocative?"
go to deleted items and it should be there.
i wonder if this is a red flag that tells you who this man really is.
maybe it is because your name is "freakgirl", but if i meet you maybe there will be no hard feelings.
i have been there and know that would be so very painful.
do you love her deeply?
have a good time in jail asking your cell mate that question.
no, the only time that you see a man that is emotions is when he is with the woman he loves.
yes, i have accomplished it and it was a blast.
you have to let the person you are with know what you desire.
of course, if she telephones me five times a day about that, then it would be absurd.
hang in there and wait for one who appreciates you.
my mom books them all the time.
besides, do you not think he has enough to worry about?
i have been seeing this man that is younger than i.
men toy with emotions to receive sexual relations, women toy with sexual relations to receive love.
it has got to get old after a while.
every person likes to be told that they are good looking, even if they do not admit it!
yes, but it depends on the guy.
maybe because you just think they look attractive when they are running on the field.
you are too young to be talking about kissing already.
i probably will tell her soon because she is my best friend, and any help would be nice.
i agree with the other person before anyone gets hurt.
i'm keen to press on, but i love him way too much
do everything that you couldn't, when you were dating them.
obviously, men are not much better.
what occurs if you inform him that you wish to be friends with benefits?
play a truth or dare game together.
he sounds like a manipulative jerk.
slow down the pace with foreplay.
death is like a big black bag full of crack, smack, or meth.
practice kissing on me, so where do you live?
no, you will not; i was married to a rude person.
it sounds as if you like her and there is not need to attempt to forget about her.
tell him ath you simply want to be friends are are disappointed by his thoughtless actions.
it cannot remain hidden, so do not do it.
what is with chest hair?
although mad and upset, he did get over you.
give your brother money and send him on his way.
no disrespect intended; but, that does sound like a lady's name.
be calm, and ask her out on a date.
when you take her out, take some time to get to know her and then go ahead and ask her out.
people do not like to be played back and forth.
practice unwrapping starburst wrappers with your tongue, the girls really like it.
i do not know, i only want the points.
that is not exactly true, it is just that most girls are discreet about it.
that depends, are you an attractive woman with a body?
i told him it was too late, but i would not have minded getting flowers sometimes.
believing in someone is a strange way to put it.
why can men never say the word "love?"
just enjoy your age and do not worry about this.
although i am nineteen, i enjoy anything up to thirty.
i had a friend in the same situation.
women are just as perverted, trust me.
you should not go out with a guy because you'need' to.
man, what you are saying is that she does not want to be more than boyfriend and girlfriend?
how long does it take for you to start feeling bored in a relationship?
i knew all the girlfriends were not the one, until i met my wife.
i think as long as the backbone of your relationship isn't intercourse, it is fine.
why do some men do that?
if you're average, breast size won't really matter.
stay away from men who cannot tell you they like you.
yes, ask for permission, then watch how fast she will slap you.
my husband likes me the way i am.
my mother also has cancer and this just gets me emotional.
then be your best self. if he is impressed or likes you, he will talk back.
you do not want anyone else but that person ever.
why don't you try chatting with and seeing other guys just to catch his reaction?
but it is okay to kiss on the first date.
men have problems with secrets.
someone got vulgar with me because i was still dating?
how do i just kiss him?
i am my only sister's maid-of-honor and i want it to be perfect.
unless it is with the wrong man.
