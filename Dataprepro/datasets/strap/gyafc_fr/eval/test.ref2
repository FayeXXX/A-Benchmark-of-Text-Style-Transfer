guys pretend to love so they can get laid, women get laid so they can feel loved

women send men mixed messages sometimes

i'm not sure if he loves you but i do know for sure that he definitely likes you.
i would ask you out but i live in oregon and i am not sure of our distance from each other.
women are complicated because that is how men see us.

the good may be better than the bad

well if your not dating then that seems kinda like a whore move
and so he was like, do you wanna use my chapstick?
well first you gotta hold her hands and look into her eyes, and then you say it, but only if you really mean it

if u did it, what was it like?
girls that drink turn me on
if thats what u want
its like getting over addiction
i should try that next time i start dating
but what do you want?
it sounds like you both like things just as they are now.
don't let yourself be dominated, she'll just have to get used to it.
if he doesn't don't be upset as you can always catch another fish.
no guy can give you what you want.
if you wanna keep being married, find yourself.
start from scratch, then go from there.
ask em if they wanna go somewhere with you.
don't keep bringing it up, trust him
i still haven't tried that but i'm working on it
find the one that luvs you for you
come around my town and i'll be ur chick

really? and you like things shoved up your butthole?
he's been telling that smack to other girls to, he's a man whore
really deep down i knew my previous girls weren't the one. then i met my wife.
no matter what, don't try to have them at the same time
sex isn't the only important thing.
i got yahoo mail it works.
fun for me includes eating you feel me lol
i mean he be busy after all that.
that would be just fucking!
don't walk up to that girl an tell her she sexy crazy.
it really sounds like you have a lot on your plate at this time.
i'm a guy, sou may want to ask another girl about those experiences.
i felt one way for a long time, but then my eyes really opened when i met the love of my life.
men are idiots, who knows why they do what they do.
your best friend is always a backup plan if you can't find someone else to marry.
i dont just want to pop out and be like will you go out with me?
lest you know him really well, you’re setting yourself up for hurt!
replace it - add it back like you did at first
if it’s your personal belief is not good or bad
those guys make you crazy bothering alllll day.
lol go to hawaii or pay a guy to do it lmao
boy/girl intelligence, how they be, pretty or ugly, laziness/active....playz a huge part in how i want them or not
i can throw em away n forget about it like yesterday’s garbage!!!
is it like that clear liquid thats yellow when it dries?
is weird when she drunk and sits on yo mans lap
it was before y’all were dating so that’s not cheating.
it always had to be his way....
determination is a self given gift.
gotta wait 2years until you get hitched to a dude.
greetings and hugs to all my cone girlllzzzzzz!
just be yourself when you are together with her
idk what you are saying
the guy asked, do you mind if we cuddle?
why would some guys do that?
there are a few good girls out there, you have to look in the right places!
you gotta move on or work it out!
get yourself together, how can you love someone you don't want to talk to?!?!
find a pretty, talented girl!
um that doesn't mean you are slutty...
this is the only chance you have to enjoy true love.
you're gonna have to find it yourself.
they gonna get ova u in 2 months
you might not see color after some time but it dependz
i think he just wants to know if you're into him
if she's not into it anymore
no worries, u r def not slutty
there's no way of making a person feel something for you
definitely end it and keep your options open
had a pap smear before
yes im proud to have long black hair
i have a buddy in the same spot
maybe age is an issue
i'm not going to give you my nname but i've worked with this person for years
i don't understand the question... can someone plz anwer
you'll tell him if you truely love him...
if your really attracted to her just follow your emotions!
think hard about if you can afford it and if you can go ahead!
um i say get your old life back so you can survive!
dude, what are you saying?
don't be flirty... its not a turn-on
some women would probably say it's painful
just tell him what you actually want, that's what they said but never did...just say something
it'd be so much easier if i was pissed
just be done if they are
this is your punishment: 1mo no tv....
just say it, its not crazy because you’ve been to get her for so long!
that’s who she is, try it differently or keep your eyes on her.
doesn’t seem simple, tell me one more time slowly.
give em a chance to notice you!!!
unless its w/ wrong guy
my bf is obsessed w/ me and doesn't wanna lose me!!!
eh depends on whether they got brown hair
its just gotta play out after awhole
everyone wants to hear that they are sexy even if they won't admit it!!
i dance in downtown houston at clubs
i say good luck... but do ur homework!
i like natural more than a face with soooo much makeup on it
if you like him then you should def go for it!
we are divorced
who said women have no emotions
actions are louder than words
im thinking about a mdeium pink hue
see if he calls emails or even gives a crap
dont ignore her, def listen and dont change the subject
hes my only $$$ til i graduate college
she;ll tell u if its not ok
im good either way i think
don't eat where you poop.
i am trying to get blonde highlights too.
just focus on school and your boyfriend.
the way you looks matter and anybody who says something else is not telling the truth.
ohh no shouldn't have done it
warm up to it, spend 5 minutes kissing and fondling you know that kind of thing
what's a unique gift to give my brother in law
be yourself man don't show off
hope it all goes great :) have fun
if they dont then just live ur life
your first kiss should be memorable
this is the most beautiful thing in family
be genuine
i kno 3 guys i can do that wit
you should tell your parents cuz you can't hide.
this is doc izzy and i <3 big girls!
u can beat his ass if he keeps flirting w her
stick with the 13 or 14 year old boys
tell him he's being a dick and you just wanna be friends
cool, its like getting your dads approval
you have 2 wait for him to ask you out or youll look despereate
i might love him but i might just really like this dude
if he wont let up he just wants to bone you
if i try really hard, i can imagine an alternate reality.
i wanna have fun with you, that's why i answered this.
is that how you feel?
give him some cash and tell him to go.
he might call.
imagine what it'd be liek without them
you gotta make it important that you see her if you want to carry on
i choose the domestic godess
are you deep in love with her?
men are always the first to get bored
get a good deal on flowers
what stuff do i need to visit the usa?
either fix it or leave, make sure your happy
not everyone is decent boyfriend material just because you think they could be
i bet she finds it ugly. blue will look better
do a citizens arrest on him
its not about the size of the pencil, its how your sign your name.
yes, this is great for all women
guys don't like secrets
well yeah, but it's up to the guy
people can't get why i'm hurrying
neither of em respect u
i totally can't talk to him even seeing him every week in psr
r u kidding, a dude who does that all da time is not for me!!!
give me a guy with nice smooth shaved legs anytime!;o
so you really on the down low or just going for a test drive
oh yeah, id say they do that for sure
now thats a reall f/up that ya can't take back!!!!
i had my cherry popped in a park when i was 16.
she says they never met but they love each other really.
ask that guy if he'll dance with you!
u should have faith and live a full life.
did you fall down? i don't know but i want to do it with you.
he knows you like him, just ask him out
dont be scared and tell him
im not gonna drive 5 hours to spend time with someone i dont like
do they gossip on the phone
play sports with ur guy friends
u feel happy and giddy when u fall in love
i cant live with my husband
we always push away those we like
if u both still think that way when you're older, do it
tell her women wanna hear the truth, good luck
u have to decide if you want to be with someone you always argue with, forever
you're a man in the slightest sense
a and b cups are the best
if you're next to an ugly dude you'll look hot as a woman
younger is better for dating...i'd date someone at least 10 years younger because who wants to be with old women??
yeah it's happened to me too and now i'm dating them
tell her wut you feel
you got naked baby pics
why do they want to marry
we did it on the hood in the rain
men don't need to grow up if women let em act like that.
do it a few times and you'll be cool.
while sex is like so fantastic!
i think hes pissed right now so he aint gonna be wit you.
fill me in if someone has the answer.
red is love, black your a goner and so on.
beefy peopel is what i like, feel ripped off with a skinny minni.
if your cluesless ask someone who would know.
when he tries to make up it will be fun
go with the one who likes you
ive been hard for her since freshman year
she was checkin you out, right?
i had no idea that life could be like this, so fantastic!
i admit it, i've got a serious crush on this guy, but i have no idea if he feels thesay way.
so, what's the best option for you and for him?
if nothing else, at least her phone number was the real deal.
it's all good, you aren't a slut!
they should get married if they can't control themselves.
she is on the phone with him all the time!
i don't see why, if you're already handing it.
i've seen you love a guy many times, but you just couldn't be sure if he felt the same.
is his mother a good enough reason to break up with him?
just be a nice dude and go for it, and if she doesn't really respond, then you know she's not feeling it.
my friends got hitched 6 months after their first date!
be yourself and ask about their life.
show her what you can do.
you look dumb.
this culture gets it right!
if ya'll don't ask you'll always wonder.
what u think? thanks
im saying dont worry so much... my 2 cents
whats the worst that could happen????
i hate 4 her 2 be that way. confused!!!! do know what to do....
look for a person who doesnt hate you
don’t be salty.....
no, most girls just hide it.
some guys don't wanna dance.
this generation is retarded
only one child? married?
well, could you trust him before?
ugly fat guys cant be picky
some poeple want to be a wife or husband
its not worth it if you only argue
enjoy asking that 2 ur cellmate in jail!
do i like u?
what'd you kiss
even i am curious about sex with another woman.
she ain't gotta be younger 20-32 is good.
the idea is simple, treat them right and with luv.
that happens, your decision will be easier.
be yourself and act nice and say nice things, chicks dig that
he cheated, which i think means i can lift or carry my husband.
make the best out of a bad set-up
u looking for dating or friends
id be good for valentines day
its very tempting :/
how long does it take for your relationship to get boring?
it just depends how fast you can get ready.
yeah i'd like to meet the girls.
it is what it is.
having online friends is cool as long as you set limits
do you want him to be your baby daddy?
he has low value if he turns you down girl
youll learn from experience, i promise
hope u married hubby coz of luv
its up to the chick. what she want?
i bet ima have someone waiting when i get home
u better go get that massage.lolz
ion know where 2 start
all depends how ur body looks, you like what u see when u look in the mirror?
are you telling me that u referring to you avatar?
rub his feet real good after you walk around with him all day!
he'll call you if he cares about you.
you keep actin like this and she gonne think you r depressed and desperate!
there's a huge different between banging and making love.
i have four kids so being a mom is more exhausting than work.
just cuz you have a kid, doesn't mean you got to stay together man.
are you from the city or country?
you can always get married and have kids later, but you can't do school later.
ive never gone to it
do you wanna have a relationship with the same guy?
how often can you have sex with pam andersen??????
make sure she doesn't end up hating your when you make your point to her
my mom has cancer too. too close to home!
running my fingers through curly hair, <3 <3 <3 <3
i mean u 2 both.
wait and the right gal will come, u will c...
i want my spouse to grow 2...
u need to make a move when there shy like that
the dr was just as surprised
u need to have fun with both, the sex is way better
do u need some practice kissing, i sure could come on over
its a yes, even if you don't agree
uh no offense but mayb its bc your name is'freakgirl' but if u showed a pic of urself maybe not
well boys do that but men dont
just try and say do you wanna go out at some point
i had this happen to me two separate times!
dont date a guy just bc you think you have to
listen if u really wanted him that bad you would not be asking me!!
i am hoping that it does not ever happen!
ladies just want guys 2 tell them how they really feel..,
u know how excited girls r when udoin it to them the right way
show her how much u want her!!
leaning in and giving me a soft kiss right on my forehead
yes im not 1 of those people -- i know there's lots of them
its all about her, and it absolutely shouldn't be something that happens on a 1st date!
ok it depends on how much you're starting to have feelings for this boy....
thank for the pep in advance
why do they want to be married?
i like gentle flirting with some romance
anyways, i married my hubby, and wonder if you know why?
lets to an amusement park or museum.
i like the guy, but how do i know if i'm in love?
which do you prefer, manicured nails or fake 1s?
don't worry about what other ppl want, plan what you want
we do all this stuff together now, i dunno what to do
i don't get u
i asked him if he likes me but he doesnt wanna do anything about it
i like your perfume
practice unwrapping starburst with ur tongue. girls like it
most guys dont care, but it depends on teh individual
it doesnt have to do with u being naive
dont get married so soon
you are bad if u cheat on ur wife
just do you. if he likes what he sees he will speak to you.
that person is the only one you want to be with.
he's about to get hitched....don't even go there!
did you let her know how annoying checking in with you every single day is?
new neighbor asked me to chill
teenage boys and girls like masterbating
he is good at bbal
dont sweat
are you someone who likes to fight?
if he wantet you instead of her he probably would have left her for you.
the most important issue is not trying to retaliate against the one who did you wrong.
one man who will go hours and miles to be with me.
omg, have you been to a doc yet?!
maybe she wasn't a biatch but the skinny girl was def!!
get a life and stop wasting my time!!!
its like the same thing as binging on chocolete then cryin about being fat
i went there and he was there
oh yeah if he's not taken then grab him
oh yeah if you dont do what they say you're gonna get a beating
well do you like him or not?
tell your mom and dad if you havnt already
most will tell you no
u think he feels the same way about u?
some guys only say love if they mean it...
he def likes u, show him how u feel!!
i think everyone should keep their own name.
guys enter and exit, but friends are forever
believe that it was considered love
you should be ready even if your relationship survives the four seasons.
some guys like chicks of that type and others, not so much
be a sham if u want kids
young dudes or old women, watch think?
he wants to keep the shit up
you better not cheat on your hubby, ya'll made vows, ijs
there is no alternative to just being "love."
your self-image is super important
i am a girl and i say that stuf...
girls can be just as perverted... trust me!!!!
flowers are nice but dont last long
i havent seen some movies
she is sweet. u should have her
use your brain not ur dick. maybe she doesnt like u
pleez dont take this the wrong way but that sounds like a girls name.
never call him back is not worth the problems.
not interisted in any ladies on my app list so i picked my neighbors sweet lady.
marraige is all trust and talking things out between each other
whatever they say to do, do not listen!
what can i do to snag her?
give her a ros44e and tell her you llove her.
it's not the norm, but it's not a bad thing either.
try working things out so you both end up happy
those girls could be enough for a man but their not up to our level
you got it, especially when she got sick.
because...as you prolly know...try to find your love...but keep a lookout!
i need more info b4 i can help u more.
there's no wrong or right way 2 kiss.
you should take ur time in deciding...
having some fun w/ ur guy friends is fine
just think about what you like to do and do the same... maybe a tongue massage!!
my so was my friend first which makes our relationship awesome!
i'd say its more of a trust issue...
i need help with this i'm screwed
if he dont like you then move right along
he doesnt want to know
if you can then make it yrself
is there anything else you do besides work and fix things?
i told her straight-up that i loved her
the senior guys think the freshman chicks are all easy, sad
how do i give him a kiss
look in the deleted items, that's where it should be
good luck finding that nice girl
that's a horrible idea, think of why you are there
that list could go on forever
be happy with anyone even if it's a man, just like brokeback mountain
don't base your whole relationship on sex
i've gotta tell her sooner than later, because she is my bestie, but any help you can give me would be awesome.
it's super bad luck if you sneak a peek at the bride on the wedding day.
stay strong out there, and i wish you the best!
it's just some lil get together for the fam.
if you're not really feeling the performance aspect, then skip it.
i just tied the knot
depends on how you were raised, how old you are, etc
no rush, you just gotta pick a last name when you have kids
don't you think your kid's gonna have a rough time being raised without their daddy?
bald men look like babies to me, it's just not cute
try it. break up. itll be harder to be friends in the future
what was the score of the last game
get rid of ur ex cause u have a better man
fly or drive to vegas to get married
yes! i want to know u way better.
c or d is just what i like. doesn't need 2 be bigger than taht.
never admit the truth just change the lies!
they never played live before so it is twice as good.
momma won't let me wear those clothes.
we haven't seen you!
cause opposites attract and you'll always find some one
i def think that this is better than my life!
dont go to the same places that you went with your ex.
talk to your bestie and lemme know if it's cool
it sounds weird, but it def worked for me in 3-5 days
i dont like when he messes with you
no im not married
some men do like big girls, most tend to be african american.
i write women poetry, am i the only one?
i told her i liked her, but she doesn't want to risk our friendship.
overlook his faults and stay with him if you care.
do they make fun of you when with him?
they are the best cause i'm a guy and i aint got to have 2 ask anyone to the event.
if your against it that much- then do'nt get married.
it depends on if their vain or not.
get over it and get someone who actually likes you.
get to know her so you can ask her out soon.
i think he was blowing me off, so i asked.
i think some young guys like asian girls.
make your own decision.
just let him know you want something low key.
i don't know why you aren't happy, since he's doing his best for you.
this is just plain bad, stuffed with lots of smaller bad things.
they've been pretty good years, but not the easiest
weve seen each other everyday for four or five years!!
pretend i'm the guy you want and date me!
hey a little flirting never hurt anyone!
you should go with your gut!
good luck.
why haven't i kissed a girl after eight months with her?
it's her choice.
they look better than lots of other nations.
the day after is alright by me.
see if she can go for movie and dinner
men get to the point. women dont
ask in english i dont get it
sorry, but i dont know...
remember, a bird has never flown with one wing
i often worry about this
youll never find a girlfriend if you are so needy
i met a girl recently, i want to know if i have a chance.
dont sit and wait for a call
be what and whot you want to be
lots of young girls date older guys. now the younger guys are insecure and search for even younger girls
if he gets it thru his head cool. if not move on
if he really loves u he'd disapoint his dad.
don't say sorry to him if u did nothing wrong...dont be weak!!
better do it before its too late
this girl does not want a shitty man.
i like hearing black woman talk baout this
hel pme argue with her
most of the men are similar to ur age
ugh, when will ppl figure this out?!
i dunno what i should do now
you go to a bar and get wasted!
i acted like that in front of my boyfriend.
if you gotta ask, it is a no.
don't just sit there and wait till he sees you for what you are.
im getting a divorce and i'm stuck with this!!
you'll be okay, just have a good time!
um your bf will think your being a jerk...
you can't fix the relationship w/ her parents but maybe ask her about helping with the relationship with her friends?
imo, i wouldn't marry a woman who wouldn't take my last name.
maybe give girls a try, since guys can be so off-putting.
i was with my ex for about 3 years before they were unfaithful.
just see what the next 6 months has in store, and you'll find out.
there is one in particular i was fond of, and it goes a little something like this.
not all guy break up with their girls
theres a lot of fun stuff there
is it alright to kiss on the first date
i have a girl friend
they wanna fuck each other
when he does tell him you messed up and you actually want to be with him and didnt want to break up
my friend thinks im too nice and should say no to them
but (there's always a but)
some guys do, not all of them, though
if you do that you can keep your last name
go up say hey and ask if she's dtf
yo that was mad hot but kinda scared me off
fat girls can be hot
not everyone here is taking classes
practice taking the wrapper off of starbursts & tyeing cherry stems....with your tongue
if u keep talking 2 him for another week, hes gonna this ur married!!! lol!
if u vote for me for best answer, i'll pay!
go to a public place. you'll be more comfortable.
work with him and pay attention to how he reacts.
and inviting someone takes the pressure off me.
please say you'll date me.
she remembers my messes.
how can i let her know that i'm not just one more guy who'll hit on her and run?
i'm a guy so let me enlighten you.
it's gonna be ok, you're 13.
don't go trail riding by your damn self.
if you two love each other, it'll be good!!!!
gotta make eye contact.
yep i can lift him.
he's gotta start again and gain ur trust.
my ex and me have history. second grade then fourth then again in 8th.
u wanna ask who out?
i'm hoping you read this really carefully
play truth or dare together!
wait till you find out and confirm, then go from there
um that is stupid bc you need a theory class for that!!!
just stop if you eat antying like that
can't stop thinking about sex with her
the only way to find out is to ask him face to face
woot jamie is asknig rubi out on a date!!
its carrying on because neither of you have the balls to end it
they seem to like learning about that
oh snap - he straight up just scored 2 points
do guys like fatter girls
he loves you too, but you gotta wait to know
if a guy respects u, he'll understand u.
we started this.....our own sins.
the dudes answer works for me.
youll be able to love him still, but get over it`
smart chicks are hot
its not right they cant go out with her
my sis closes her eyes when she goes to kiss someone
i met my last bf in a roundabout
yeah hes getting hitched later this month
idk whether to let go and move on, what do you think?
do you ever replay what u did to me?
it wounds like you two got hitched already.
first why didn't the relationship end?
he may call if you leave him alone.
you should let more know.
take it a day at a time, like step by step. think on how he let a good thang get away.
um, heya harold, dinner still on?
if ya gotta ask, then no!
go on and go to school, you can come home anytime or hit up your friends and fam.
i never wanna have sex w anyone ever again!!
let him approach u first, you will look crazy if you go to him first!
some people just dont do it bc of religious beliefs.
guess you ok with yourself.
it's your choice if you feel comfortable with them.
thinking to much is not going to provide assistance if he is truthorthy.
are woman sexually attractive and beautiful are they?
see if she's going to hit you!!
you're trying too hard dude!! be yourself!
see what he's willing to do for you
but that doesn't mean that u cant love each other
how would they know you if you don't tell em anythin
it dont matter what they think
what wulaitities do u want in a girl
women like thoughtful men
i feel weird
stay cool, acting hard to get might help
look how she walking!
why would he care if ur at the dance together
girls love men who are confident.
after class ask her to go out with u
u need help. see a therapist.
i'm still in love with him for some reasons.
that works for me. i like to give when i get a little something in return.
go get something that can't ditch. whatever!
you've only met creeps with weird fetishes
i'm not telling u to not get some tail till then(;
dont make him dance if he doesnt wanna
i'm a dude, but i'll tell you what i know
my bae won't give me luv in person
no idea if she meanz it

hubby n i luv my dope blk hair
people choose stuff so quickly
they are trying to be something they're not.
i was already married to a jerk, so no!
that guy friend stay away!
i want a girl who wants to be around me.
it was the best thin 4 me
i had a fling with a dude one time who i met in a rainstorm
u gonna get paid if u work for me

you better choose one and know why yo
wait 4 years
im happy with brown hair
get aposrt or vehicle stuff for ur gift to ur husband
that isn't what you can be
the prob is that he did the worst thing possible he cheated on me recently!
use your imagination... and imagine you and him together at night!
it really hurt and i started to bleed!
honestly, it could mean a lot of different things...
let's do lunch...in 10 years.
eye contact's good but give'em a grin!
no friend you want to take a break from, ever?
he's on my s**t list for doing that.
i know what i want and who i want it with
it happened right there in the middle of the river, i fell over laughing
if you are hot, show your tits to him
so its natural for him
i got excited when i saw a malysia air commercial
go out and do all sorts of stuff you couldnt when you werent single
its extremely possible to enjoy giving more than receiving
am i crazy for not moving on after 6mo?
go back to foreplay if you feel it start coming on.
most guys will be into you regardless...usually.
it’s definitely challenging.
thailand is full of woman strolling along, just ask one!
u gotta last at least 30-45 min.
trouble is i dig him a lot.
it's buy on get one man.
pakistan is so conservative, i did not know.
we can wrestle and be best friends.
i basically only see him around my brother's basketball games.
that was pointless. where do you all live?
you gotta let her know what you like about her.
it's just a phrase that means they aren't into you.
nothing lasts forever, and everyone grows apart.
i was working there for a bit when i met my lover.
i'll go and check one out
don't wait, jump on it
girl, more dudes in the world like fat chicks than you think
i was pretty casual when i said it, i really didn't think he'd remember i said that!
chicks don't like a dude that's selfish and only gives a crap about himself
look right at it.
a cd or dvd is good probably.
you both toil hard to be sure it is done well.
she'll call if she is interested.
i care about you alot and you are always on my mind.
would you reccomend giving him a second chance down the road a ways?
if you think your relationship is suffering, work on it.
daniels hasn’t read one of them “manga books”.
use this if they actually apply.
i went through the same kind of thing too.
maybe she just wants to play the field?
think about which one you like the best, and pick them.
be ready if she's out of here.
i dumped all my issues on him and maybe i shouldn't of.
idk, i'd just get over it.
you'd get over it if you lose him.
sometimes u gotta check your beau...
get the snacks if he bought the tix
you both on the bounce so it's cool.....
my girl is intense, thats why i luv her so!
you will met that good dude one day!
be strong, you'll be great.
what about green and blue?
some guys do, some don't.
i want a kind, smart female.
it could have been worse - at least it not bella!
its more like 65-70% not 90%.
what good did that do?!
what she wants really who knows.
my bff cant stand my guy and lives for the day we break up, but i know well stay together forever.
we just saw each ohter than one time.
you sent out over 1000!!!!
my freinds dont let it go further than kissing
happy birthday bro
ladies use there brain
act like a gentleman and ask her questions about herself
how long does it have to be bfore you figure out that it's taking too much times and she's just not that into you?
girls don't like smoking. they know that guys who do it are committing suicide.
i can only be myself when i'm with guys i'm not into, and we all know how that works out.
the timing with the old guy wasn't right - you'll see!!!
take them both out of a date!!!
i'm my only sis's maid of honor i want it to be perfect!!!
i hate sleeping cause my bf snores
if they dont get along they should be friends why do u care what they think

tell her to call for immportant stuff only
i gotta stop cause i gotta pee
youd b the furthest thing on my mind after 3 days.
did ya feel the need to say that!???
i'm agree wit the other guy befoer anyone gets hurt.
peeps arent yo-yo's so dont toy with with.
ooh, i'll have what she's having.
just be loving and sweet, and that will earn big points with her.
guys have a bone, and ladies have a bean.
after being together for so long, and going through so much, you can't help but love your wife.
hm, i don't need a high maintenance girl - i want a companion!
ugh, i hate it but i like the straight variety.
if she like him then there has to be a motivation...
you can't trust anyone more than you trust a good friend!
i mean thats weird but idk what do i know, ill see what my friend thinks by the lockers later
if you look ok then he wont really care how big your boobs are
i mean i'm a guy i feel things you know
call the q&a team they'll help you. have a good day
i go for smart, fun and good looking girls
that's great, that girl gave me a perfect answer
if they want they type of pic it's sex
so exactly where do you find all these filipino women?
you could ask him to grab some food or see a movie, something like that.
no i like dudes who are regular looking.
someone was being a punk to me because i was still dating.
i love him but i'm over it.
if you ask her for permission she's gonna lose it.
men are so full of themselves thinking they're all that and can pick and choose women.
i want sex occasionally
i have heard it alot
you're the dom in that relationship for sure
one that appreciates you'll come along, just wait
stay away from there, i don't trust it
it depends on how it looks
let him go and move on. if it is meant to be he iwll come back
the guy i like is mad at me
do you like asian food like chinese or japanese?
my cousin met this bizarre old weirdo online that had convinced her he was a dirty teen.
if you really want to know, no, i'm not in love.
actions speak louder than words, so watch out for that.
always be yourself, and never let a guy tell you how to be.
still love'em, but dont know what to do
just talk to your wife about it
give'em the doughy eyes and that'll be enough
you could stop beating around the bush and tell her like it is
if you ask that, it's totally gonna kill the mood, so i suggest just having fun together.
and then there's making out and asking how if they enjoyed it.
jules sac cracks me up, but he's kind of a jerk.
have you seen my boyfriend around lately?
if a dude is stuck on himself, it's not hot.
i can tell cause i'm just like ur wife
you ain ready if u gotta ask the folks
get all tarzan-like with the shit and rip your shirt off!
nove on and get a new man if u don't love hubby no more
be honest and say nice stuff
i like a 6th grade boy too
they feel insecure around stupid guys
we can go on a date and see if we like each other
i'll be expelled if she tell the administration bc its pakistan, not the us
my friend is in an online relationship
i love cuddling with a biggggg woman
i'm pretty sure the bomb is a lot easier!
his dad comes from his part of the family tree, and i've met him before.
anything thats easy to pick up
be her friend first then her boyfriend
she cheated on me for 3 years
hit him cause he likes someone else
do not let dem know in advance but radder allow dem tuh discovuh once yuh are in bed togethuh
it is not so impawhtant here in america
be confident and always believe in yawhself. yuh got me so fahr? do not become arrogant, though. okay? always make good eye-contact and listen tuh what she has tuh say
let it take its cawhse
i know becawze i dates someone like dat
yeah i totally shoudlve listened to my friends
just leave him if he's being a dick
you should just do what makes you happy and ignore every1 else :)
we sort of tried to move on but it was useless
if you don’t pop the question someone else will beat you to it.
this twin of mine won’t talk or listen to me....
she’s gonna answer you because she’s polite.
you didn’t marry him for nothing.
ask if he will go to movies with u
some girls can find atractive guys their age
it dont matter. were just friends
in that situation, take a self defense class
thats what i see
wow she is sooooo drunk!
u gotta take time to get to know them both w/out dating them
do you get that he loves you?!
u can join a community with webcam and live chat
i tell ya - those were good times!!!
if your promiscuous then so is he!
i guess they lgot preferences idk
would be cray if she called 5x a day
u might be his one and only luv
tell that idiot to gtfoh
omg how old are you now?
they want to run other peoples lives but its not working
if thats true and u really like him, let him go.
someone i can just be me with
the rest is so easy from here
if u tell them you love them and u have to wait for them to say it back, you'll know everything.
i just got out of a 3 yr relationship with my baby daddy
i wish you all the best in finding the one!
i know it's been awhile, but i still haven't fallen out of love with him.
i know he knows how you feel about him, but has he responded?
everyone has their own tastes and types when it comes to attractive.
my wife has the patience of a saint, and forgives me a lot.
if you tell you him you wanna get with him casually, what will happen?
i am totally into him and he says he would get with me if i was single.
women are more bad than men are!
she is using you, man!
stop doing things that will hurt you.
you'd be surprised if u knew what kinds of ppl like him
hold off til you're 25, you wont lose your appeal by then
so that's how u do it if you really set on it
do guys even know what they want in a relationship?!
stay away from your ex, its not good.
go with it if it is something you like.
you have to remember you are in this forever!
who cares if she asks for your number?
why do so many girls say flowers won't last if it is yes?
don't look at the way she looks first!
the question shouldn't bother her at all if you guys are seriously into each other
if i was gonna go, i'd say do the bahamas... or maybe maui
asking her out at work or not, that's ur problem
the way he asked me out, girl, you wouldn't believe how nice that was
you've really made a double standard there.
i'm not a wife and can't say from that experience but maybe mine is as good
you're right to feel let down and mad.
then he got to his stop and got off the train.
you've gotta start at the beginning and look down the road 20 years
you should never be scared to just say no.
seriously, let it go, regardless of what he says, because she's hurting enough already.
well, there's the fact that if it doesn't pan out the way you wanted, your job is gone.
how about getting your dance on at the club?
i missed many a opportunity focusing on others instead of myself
what do i have to do to stop these trolls
when you're a young adult you say stuff you dont mean
in gods name why would he shave his legs
smile make eye contact and... be nice!!!!
well what do you guys think
hey guys... when it comes to girls do you like em big or small?
she doesnt want it to just be about her looks though
wooohoo good luck then :d
i told a girl once i loved her
if she says yes, pick her up
if you want her as a friend, you want something deeper
keeping secrets hurts your loved ones
be real and manly. most women like that, but especially if you're real.
forget what the others are saying.
any man who said he would is prob lying to himself
forget his ass, get with his brother instead.
death is basically a box of candy corn - it gives you cavities hahahah!
um yeah i wouldn't want a pair that big!
others like to do as society says but i think we should rebel and love thick girls!
that just makes having sex with her easier!
if youre that attracted to him, you should call him
its cause you don't have any say in the decision
hey, its your life make your own decisions!
i say get younger and younger guys as you get older to make yourself feel better!
btw i'm not the kinda girl who likes a romantic dinner at home.
imma do this jus so i cn get points
dat's a risk u gon hav 2 take
work on your relationship but don't be nobody's prisoner
no matter what u do, don't be tellin him 2 soon!
don't shit where you eat
if you and your significant other love the movies, then go together.
you know, foreplay, right between threeplay and fiveplay.
you should buy a sexy adult toy that will make you both happy.
every man has an ego you just have to deal with it :(
yeah i agree w/ udaman
i like him alot but i don't want him to reject me :(
i only think of him in my dreams.
prolly not till he finds a new girl
have fun, see new people
don't do anything you'll regret later.
to be safe when dating online, only talk by email or phone
ya, i did it and it was a ton of fun
there's lots of cheap ideas, find out what you want to do and go from there
you might be over looking for men who give u respect
you'll find your one, mrs. right someday
if u can fart in front of someone your in love
i cant wait to see it
walk up and talk bro
tell me how old you r cuz it'll help.
i think so too, its nasty to act like that
banish the psycho monsters from public, theres not enough room 4 every1.
you mean it's provoking what?
r u f**kin with me kid?
it's almost like saying, what can stop me after i have already done it?
you can save tons of money if you pick the right day.
i'm not going to say anymore.
why dont men evr say love?
if she luvs u, ur gf should chill with her shade
he said to come wit u
just thinkin with the other head
its from a back spasm.
maybe they should take our last names instead.
your gunna have no friends left bc you keep choosing a guy!
youll feel it if he really likes u!!!
i love that they ar eup for a challenge
drop a tape for her.
i wanna be happy
don't try to have sex
occasionly, when in a romance with someone, i feel embarrassment
when you ready, it be worth it.
you too good for those people.
um, does that mean he likes me
the guy should def take the first step!
if it was up to me, i would of just kept my last name
you need to just separate the bad stuff and move on man!
go find out how he is.
i'm heading out to hook up with peoples.
i'm so pissed at my cousin cause he knows i still feel her.
damn, you were right!
enjoy v day with fun and gifts and happiness!
its only for appearances...
oh yeah, they never had a prayer!
i think they both like me tho...
they into tiny ladiez
remember to vote for the best!
be and hubby been together for 4 yrs and got hitched in 2005
navy piers got good food, hotels museums and places to eat
they always cheat on each other.
no worries even i don’t have many choices.
momma books em at pat@alanatvl.com
6mo later and i still can’t forget about it.....
she felt that it was necessary to move to the bay state.
i don't care, honestly, just a little bit works for me.
some women prefer gifts that won't wither like flowers.
despite being a strong female who loved deeply, she wasn't really happy inside.
means you're pretty young if sixth graders are your thing.
what u look like on the outside shouldnt matter at all!
you mean what they think about lgbt relationships?
yeah just kiss him, that will give you your answer.
got his phone, put in my number.
if you wanna have a good time, check out a restaurant or nightclub or gym.
so i'd say that they do succeed, but not very often - hope this helps...
look me up if you are in florida!
hey, just ask her on a date!!!
sorry i dont know, good luck to you both!
i wanna visit your country.
get another sexy chick, so she can hate.
don't ask if you don't wanna be salty.
she knows i care 4 him so i dunno what to do
so last item, he always stare like that?
4play slows down the pace. try it
white skinned ppl look paler with black hair
no way was i gonna let her be first!
you don't call a woman a fatass!
wanna hear a dirty joke?
if you didn't play the guilt trip you know it would be.
it seems he is having too much fun while you're gone.
yes, i'm sure anyone would.
some couples will never be that easy with one another.
it's obvious men aren't much better.
second date with him nevvvvver happened.
its cause your the prettiest thing they ever saw.
luckily you have found the love of your life...you should be with them.
if he is worthy you wont need to do a god damn thing!
whoah did you seriously just start talkin about kissing when you are so young??
order one online and then… bam... a magical stork brings one right to ya!
it gets harder as you go!
just keep doing you. don't worry, there are plenty of other fish in the sea.
what's their age?
just smile thru it
quit talking with that bum and get him off your mind!
girls whinnin bout flowers should be happy they got em
lol why i don't date
girls are pretty or nice to talk to
i dont like girls
stop seeing your cousin and ex
ive never given a girl a xmas gift unless i like her
who can tell is country girls are hot
you know i met mine at a carnivle
my husband loves me for who i am
no way, she's not a liar
if they don't do it, you need to just move on girl
pick which flowers and arrangement you like.
if he doesn't care who else matters?
you can do better than him.
she lets me watch cartoons and watch cartoons
lime green is good for summer weddings
what can i do
the right relationship will happen on its own time
if you're fixated on looks, you're trying way to hard to prove yourself.
i want your brutal honesty, i can take it.
how about going to grab some breakfast, and follow that up with a pleasant morning walk.
i did this by mistake. my friend blocked me
dont fuck
be nice when u tell ehr
you guys should kiss when you are ready!
ask her actual questions... don't just say random things
i think youre a good guy and she probs loves you a lot!
text her back if she calls you
nooooo! not acceptable! your just ruining your health bc girls don't like it!
find that specifal someone you like and ask them to be ur valentine!
tell her that you miss her and love her
if nothing will work, ask him again.
some do have it and some don't.
he won't tell you know if you ask.
george clooney looks nice in this picture.
my partner wants me to look different
those replies are cocky, i’m way hotter
gross teeth, halitosis, and bo
nothing that’s said can make this better.
if men just knew how to make women happy the world would be better
so, you want to blow another dude?
i'd rather you not get hitched.
as a guy i find that payment is not necessary.
if he wants to put these pants on, he needs to say the word.
so what if it is a rebound relationship for the two of you?
good luck in your search for the one!
why does everyone seem to want somebody that they cannot have and know that they should not want.
do you like to argue and fight?
so that is the way to go if you are set on that.
my three years ex cheated on me.
work at it but don't let him keep you locked up at home.
other than those two things, just ask him once in a while.
also men get bored and tire way before women do.
she is strong, loving, and was not as happy as she thought.
it is one way of saying, "i do not like you."
king made a song about this: "only your mother loves you (and she might be jiving too)."
he loves you, as well. time will tell.
my partner wants me to change my appearance.
i know i have someone who will be waiting when i come home.
i want to have sex with my partner, but we must be careful.
do you want all your friends forever?
that does not mean that you are promiscuious.
you can try and go to a club and dance.
do not go to any place that you went with him/her.
there is pleanty to do, and it is a lot of fun.
it all depends on when you are ready.
stay one hundred miles away from this guy.
just be prepared because if it happened once, it can happen again!
i am looking for a girl who wants to spend time with me.
probably not until he finds another girl.
the wife told me that we do not wear that.
if you have that question, then you should break up and open up to other options.
why do gay people want to get married?
you will just humiliate yourself if you apologize to him without committing a mistake. do not get weak!
do you have to make a fast choice?
they both do not respect your feelings.
i sincerely urge you to consider how many overly confident women exist.
she is too frightened to invite him on a date.
accept reality. how can you love a person with whom you do not even communicate?
i would invite you on a date but i live in oregon and i am entirely uniformed as to where you live.
they have never performed before and this doubles the pleasure.
i will likely go and see one.
either way, best of luck to you, however, i am glad that you have brown hair.
mail me a photo to my email address honorarius@yahoo.com and i will tell you.
it is absolutely a challenge.
well, i am female, so i will help you out.
don't state it specifically, let them figure it out when you're together.
if i could, i would have kept my last name.
i hardly ever see him in school, usually i see him when i go to my brother's basketball games.
he is telling that to some other girls as well.
reject him. there are many options for romantic partners.
i know because i am exactly the same as your wife.
when she telephones, respond with a text message.
not at all. i am five feet four inches tall and he is 6 feet 2 inches tall. `
do you not know the most important rule? trust no one.
we've tried to break up several times, but we can never manage to make it stick.
some people are attracted to thin and skinny people because the anorexic look is in.
if you have male genitals, then it shouldn't be a problem, just penetrate her genitals when you become erect.
may i suggest taking some self defense classes?
i just left a three year relationship with my child's father.
what happened to the politician when he took viagra?
hi my name is going to remain anonymous, but i have been working together with this person for years.
i just feel that woman are complicated.
we like to be approached softly, with some slight chasing.
you would very surprised to see the type of people that are attracted to him.
it is very enjoyable, especially when you finally meet after texting for a few months.
i am in new york city and will help you out if you are around.
it sounds strange but it worked in three to five days for me.
do not worry as i am not working with much either.
if they do not get along, then do not spend time with them and do not worry what they think.
if he is, then you have a wonderful partner.
if he is interested in you, you will just know.
i guess that it is normal, but i would move on.
the rest becomes easy after this.
i like a man who is funny.
only you can decide on this issue.
why are you asking me this question?
do not tell everyone, just because you think it is right.
!0 years is a nice age gap.
then if he still does not like you, move on.
okay, i see him every week in psr, but i just cannot talk to him.
they feel insecure around less educated men.
for one thing, if it does not work out, then there goes your job.
i hope that it does not ever pass.
avoid the ones that are not worth your time.
it is about the looks.
there is no reason for you two to dislike each other.
if you don't ask the question, you will always wonder about the answer.
some people choose not to do that because of their religion.
you should give it a chance. if you end up breaking up with that person, it will be harder to be friends with them.
i wish you the best of luck!
i do not like being with men who are not ready to commit to a relationship.
this is an important day in both of your lives. it should not be done hastily or without consideration.
i am 55 years old and continue to live at home with my mother. what is wrong with that?
one man is willing to move 21 hours or 1,400 miles simply to be with me.
i must not be unattractive enough in that case.
however, that is fine. i am generous, if you understand my implication.
well, the dependence is in the woman's camp. what is it she prefers?
don't forget, it requires a pair, as opposed to a single.
if his affections tended away from her and toward you, he likely would've terminated the romance to be with you.
remain on the premises to the point in which the saloon shuts it doors for the day -- alternatively, stop by a penitentiary.
be so kind as to refrain from neglecting this event!
because, believe it or not, women dislike cocky men.
stick with what is inside of you.
well, it happened to me two times.
maybe you are young, i do not know.
no matter what he says, actions speak much louder than words.
there is nothing in this world like a big-boned girl.
even if he is rich, do not sell yourself.
i just moved to sacramento and am a thirty-year-old gay male.
the people such as your friends who are around you now should like you regardless.
because they like the breasts and genitals.
if you both feel the same way when you are older, then go for it.
i am not one of those people; but, i know there are plenty of them.
i would assume "no", especially since you have to ask.
you want to suck another man's phallus?
i like to think that women are not as sophisticated as we men are.
does this mean he likes me?
do not worry about him, just focus on school so you can learn.
i know because i dates someone like that.
look at the way she walks.
no, i certainly hope not.
hello, i am interested in visiting your country.
over time, should i give him another chance?
is that the same man you want to have a relationship with?
i went, and there he was.
that is what i had called it, but why?
that way you will still be able to use your last name.
both of you have worked hard to make it right.
i have told her that i like her but she said she would not want to ruin our friendship.
you can join a community site with live chat and webcam chat.
show her your naked baby pictures.
it is very important to last at least 30-45 minutes.
but, i am not telling you to be celibate until then.
if he is flirting with her, then gang up on him.
i love to run my fingers through curly hair.
i want my wife to grow also.
well, i guess that is just the way it is.
one girl named michelle, who probably does not mind being named, spoke up and said she did not believe in it.
i can just toss him to the side like trash and forget about him; but i am joking.
he was a little busy after that.
i do not know what to do because she knows how much i care for him.
if you do eat something like that then you should just quit.
it could be that you need to urinate or it could be the last dream that you had.
if he wants to wear my pants all he has to do is ask.
if you were friends before and you have stronger feelings now, then it should be okay.
i want to try again.
figure out what style of arrangements and flowers you like.
lie, lie, lie and then lie some more.
wait till you find out for sure, then go from there.
he should not really care, if you two are at a dance.
trust him, and do not bring the matter up again.
honestly, most women are just waiting for the man to tell her how he truly feels.
yes, i would love to meet the ladies!
now and again, i actually ponder this one.
i met a very romantic man in a large rainstorm.
some men like women who behave that way and others do not.
it comes after three-play and before five-play.
i feel foolish when i fall in love.
if you must ask, then you are not in love.
if you start to feel something coming on, re-start the four play.
i do not understand the question. would someone please give me the answer.
i saved $500-600 doing my own flowers for my wedding and it was not a hassle.
i just went through a divorce, and he did as well.
ask a girl about those symptoms, because i am a boy.
be yourself, show a bit of toughness, that is what girls like, at least most girls, but above all be yourself.
follow your heart, it is never wrong.
they annoy you all throughout the day.
watch for if he telephones, sends an electronic mail or even cares.
you can attempt a civilian arrest.
usually you feel a spasm in your back.
by now, you may love your wife just for everything the two of you have endured.
i hope that everything works out for you.
tell this person you love them, and then wait for their answer.
attempt to invite her on a date again and observe her response.
there is no way to force a person to fall in love with you.
ask her question; do not merely speak.
when you first fall in love you are giddy, bemused, and light-hearted merely thinking of that person.
and remember that there is more than one.
i just think they look better than a many other nations out there.
once again, we got married!
overall, i do not think that it really matters.
and i am certainly not driving five hours just to spend time with her, unless i really liked her.
how often can you have sexual relations with pamela anderson?
i told her i sincerely loved her.
what good did it do?
i do not like to break another one's heart.
give them a rose and express your love for them.
i like the thick ones because the thin ones make me feel cheated.
remember, "until death do you part".
because we always find a life partner and it is usually someone that is the opposite side of us.
what are you talking about?
if you keep on talking to him for another week, then he is going to think he is married to you.
women do not want that much, just some acknowledgement and occasionally a little help.
that is what it seems like to me.
do no be afraid to say no.
end the relationship, there are always more fish in the sea.
it does not matter to me, though a handful is quite ehough.
choose the one the adores you the most!
you released at least a thousand of them.
you went to a bar and drank too much.
think about it before you act.
you should not leave them but instead teach them what to do better.
bembie got it right.
no, the two of you kiss when you are ready.
user julesac is amusing, but rude.
if you are asking this, then you must have already distanced yourself from her yet remain as a friend.
don't forget to vote for what you think is the best answer!
don't try to figure out the answer, that is just how it is.
i don't know, but i do have another website that i visit.
it depends on how strongly you feel about this man.
he must be very controlling.
everything depends on the individual woman and her level of interest in the man.
search out and attempt new activities in order to meet people.
in most cases there are multiple issues rather than only one.
if you truly care for them.
for the young men: is your preference a larger woman or a petite woman?
if all you do is fight it is not worth it.
what makes it even more horrible is that i already went out with him for four years!
you just need to be patient and the appropriate lady will come along.
if you no longer love your husband and you have a place for another man?
a wife, because you can accomplish more without commiting a sin.
she absolutely desires for you to think she is attractive, but she does not want that to be the number one reason.
it depends, some days i desire to have sexual relations, other days i do not.
also, they are more passionate when they make love.
should you have fun with the pair of them simultaneously, she'll most likely have rough sex with you.
on account of his refusal to remain employed, his physical abuse towards me, his usage of guilt trips as blackmail, and his role as a dependent "mama's boy," and so on.
perhaps since you are the most attractive young lady they have ever encountered.
it's strongly dependent on whether or not a person is vain.
a person i'm able to act naturally with.
send me you photograph, and contact me.
stay away from this male friend.
the doctor cannot even believe it.
yes, for sure. especially, when she vomits!
if not, do not sweat it!
i could give you some pointers.
if you feel that you love is fading, do not just sit there and do nothing!
i will not stay with someone that i do not trust.
there was only one time i told a girl i loved her and meant it.
you married him and it was for a reason.
take off your shirt and do a tarzan yell.
yes. down there, do not have sex.
they accept this in their culture.
always ride the trail with a friend.
you did not give us very good information; do you all live in one house?
move on because it does not matter if he is attractive; looks are not everything.
the most important thing is to just be yourself.
you should be disapointed and mad.
i have never felt that way.
i would not like any girl who would make my life difficult.
if he gets the tickets, you get the popcorn.
you can practice, and ask if you are doing good.
if you are positive, then first tell your parents, if you have not already done so, that is.
i met mine at a carnival.
that sounds like a rhetorical question.
i believe that everyone should keep their name.
your initial kiss should feel like you are in heaven.
this situation is a challenging one with lots of problems.
how to keep a woman content.
please abstain from doing things that might be harmful to you.
you will be compensated more if you are willing to work more.
do not approach her and let her know that you find her looks very attractive.
i don't think it's a good idea, you are not there for that purpose.
go up to her and say "hi, are you single?"
i think he would make a great valentine.
just be prepared to let her go.
rather than just sit there and wait, you are a good one.
just tell them, what will they do, slap you?
get away from it all, go enjoy a massage.
well, if you really like this man, smile and talk nicely to him.
take them both out at the same time.
it happened to me and now i am dating that person.
first, plan what you desire and do not worry about what everyone else desires.
you may just be over looking the type of men who think the most of you..
preferrably a person who does not dislike you.
we attempted to move on, but it did not work out.
when will people in this messed up world finally realize this?
i would not bother calling him back.
try not to be around him, and find another guy.
look for another attractive girl, so she will be jealous.
so in my opinion you are not a promiscuous woman.
red equals love, black equals death, etc.
break up with her. if she is attracted to him, then she is not attracted to you. it is not his fault that she strays.
for me, after three days, i might start to forget about you.
find a girl, who is pretty and has talents.
there is no one you can trust more than a good friend!
you could start the day by eating breakfast out, then take a nice walk.
if she says yes, then go pick them up.
if yes is the answer, why did i hear a girl say that flowers will not last?
it may be that it is interesting for them to learn about that.
could it ever be the same?
it is not that bad because at least it is not bella.
could it be because some men are just liars?
or you could tell her and have one of those fairy tale romances.
that is a culture that has things right.
my twin will not talk or listen to me.
do you want to get something that you can not get rid of.
i am not thinking about him, but i am having dreams about him.
i think it would be fine to get a video game.
go after it and take the chance.
if he can not, then perhaps take him on a dinner date to a place where you can slow dance.
i feel that this is the most beautiful part of a family life.
it is your choice not to hate one but i dislike them at the very least.
do not get married without a prenup.
do not waste my life.
did she say you were too good for her?
friends are forever because guys come and go.
it could mean many things.
affirmative, it is commonplace because many people exist who have residual fondness for a former romantic partner.
i'd enjoy hearing the viewpoint of an african american woman regarding this subject.
men are unintelligent! what person understands the meaning behind their behavior?
well, if they delivered to you their contact details, you require no waiting period whatsoever.
because they served as masters of the entire cosmos.
i am in love, and i do not care who knows it, buddy the elf.
and whatever you do, do not try to have both of them at once.
you would not be asking, if you really wanted to be with him.
remember: being friends with someone online is fine, but there are limits.
my sister closes her eyes when she prepares herself to kiss someone.
personally now, i would refrain from wedding any female unwilling to relinquish her surname, however, that is merely my feeling.
um, modest get-together for relatives.
females are sexual deviants. they simply conceal it and behave as such in the company of other females covertly.
also, i've merely made it to grade five, yeah!
what is your desire, however?
please don't do that. it will not work.
if they don't love you, then it is time to move on.
he is everything i wanted with his looks and money.
it is bad look to see the bride in her dress before the wedding ceremony.
she is not a liar.
you can be whoever you are.
he has his nose pierced.
i can lift him.
you would need a therapist for that.
perhaps some sexually deviant men like the very young looking asian girls.
you should probably go and see a psychiatrist.
he is giving you stupid, off-the-wall excuses and acting in ways that he did not before.
be strong and hold on.
no, he is too large and i am too weak.
if she is so intoxicated that she becomes sloppy or uncooth, then yes, it is unattractive.
keep in touch with each other. you can exchange letters, e-mails, online chat, talk over the phone, and send packages.
especially when you don't feel like it.
he dribbles, he shoots, he scores: two points.
having sex to have a male stay with you, is similar to selling your soul to the devil.
i'm unable to give you a wife's view, but hopefully mine is just as well.
as well, it takes the pressure off of me to ask.
it depends upon the woman. i prefer shaved.
ask in proper english. i cannot comprehend your meaning.
i'm a man. i'll inform you what i'm aware of.
i enjoy passing time with him. i want to win him over, not push him away.
all right, i am very, very into this one man and i'm unaware as go his feelings in return.
by the by, the avatar you're using has some familiarity for me.
the time elapsed equals more than six months and it seems i'm unable to move on.
it's possible he believes he'll be rejected. simply inquire. i'd do so.
you must contemplate that and it should provide assistance in determining whether or not he's trustorthy!
it is a picture in the shape of a heart with both of you in it from when you first dated.
he is my only source of income until i graduate from college.
i was with my ex boyfriend in the second grade and then in the fourth grade and then again in the eighth grade.
is it bad if i have not kissed the girl i have been with for eight months?
there are men that do not like the breast of a woman.
maybe she just wants to date other people?
we have seen each other every day for 4 -5 years.
he arrived at his station, so he left the train.
the absolute worst thing would be her saying no. go for it and good luck!
i know exactly what i desire in a relationship.
i would flirt with him and send flowers and candy to yourself. then he would ask you out.
i also despise seeing my dad unhappy.
i know i snore sometimes, and i feel bad.
i need to know if i am in love.
if you love eachother, you can work out the fights.
you both do not want to call it quits.
that does not mean that big girls can not be cute.
he is, however, getting married this month.
those guys are jerks, and you don't want to associate with them.
please say you will go out with me.
you should get married only after you have been with a man for at least two years.
men have a peni and women have a clitoris.
separate the undesirable thing and move on.
it would be easier to do if i were upset, however.
if she tells the administration i will be expelled because it is pakistan, not america.
you should becom acquainted with her and sooner or later one of you will ask the other out.
he knows that you like him, so just ask him on a date.
maybe we can go on a date and we will find love with eachother.
i am married now.
you need to date some new people.
as everyone has told you, do not get married too early.
i want to know if you have been to the doctor yet.
pay attention to what the other person says.
talk to your spouce about this.
you are young if you are interested in sixth graders.
what color would go well with a medium pink color?
ask them if they want to go someplace with you.
a trip to an amusement park including roller coasters or perhaps a theatrical museum.
or do you fellows prefer larger women?
the problem is that i care for him very much.
therefore i would say that they do succeed but not frequently. i hope this is helpful.
should i break up with him because of his mother?
i accidentally did this in the past and my friend was angry that i deleted him.
i do not think i mind either way.
but that is her way. you could attempt it that way or you could remain watchful.
there are some that do, but you should be able to notice.
are you talking about your avatar?
i do not ever remember giving a woman a christmas gift, unless i liked her.
i do not know what to do.
try to be yourself, and not show off.
so, just take id daily and step-by-step. think of how he lost a good thing.
it is a shame that if only every man knew what women wanted, the world would be a much happier place.
give her compliments, honesty, and make it about her.
i believe that she will hurt him.
it only means that she is very interested in the man.
please do, but i believe that you would get slapped or kicked in the groin while you are in mid-reach.
she and i are only just now both divorced.
if the person wants to see your picture right away, it is about sex.
it is better than if you giver her a fake telephone number to call.
ask her to move to massachusetts.
if you feel this strongly about it, then maybe you should not get married.
based on the pictures i have seen, i would say maui or the bahamas.
the man i am attracted to is angry with me.
you are thirteen-years-old, so do not even worry about it.
that way you do not have to worry about calling him too much.
i am a man, and let me tell you, "we love to chase."
in advance, thank you for the pep.
we always seem to push away the ones that we love.
they think that they can control the lives of others when they cannot.
that is strange but perhaps. i do not know. i will speak to my friend later next to his locker.
i do not know. would you enjoy having an item inserted forcefully in your rectum?
if the man cares then he calls.
what gift can i give my future brother in law for his birthday?
he does not want to, either.
you can say it, but only if you mean it. also hold her hands, and look into her eyes.
some guys do; and some do not.
i would very much like to know so please assist me.
the timing simply was not right for it with the elderly man. you will see.
generally kind. and for my fifth, i will simply be disappointed if she is unintelligent.
it is one of the gifts we can always give ourselves.
i do not believe that you have to earn someone trust. i do not see how that is possible.
if that describes you, then you certainly need to stop. that is strange.
do not let her control you. she needs to learn to deal with it.
i have a yahoo e-mail address and that is sufficient for me.
do not concern yourself with it.
they never had a chance.
you know you were meant to be together if you can break wind in front of each other.
how old are they?
and any man who says he would is probably not being entirely honest with himself.
if you flirt with him, there is no challenge.
if you need your ex emotionally, then you have some troubles ahead.
twenty to thirty-two is fine and she does not have to be younger than you.
maybe she does not love you but try using your brain and not your heart.
if you want your girlfriend forever, do not let her know that you want her forever.
tons of cheap ideas are out there, find what you like and work with it.
if you are worried about doing it, performance wise, do not do it.
find another woman and if it does not work out, move back.
most often (not every time) that will be boys around your age, give or take.
if you act like that all of the time, she may believe that you are desperate.
not every person here is in school.
tell him what you really desire, that is what i was told, but i never got to do it, speak up.
should i attempt the first interaction or should i wait for him to make his attempt first?
what a typical double-standard you have set up!
after a while, you do not even see the color.
i have not tried it yet, but i am still trying to wok up the nerve to.
asking her that question should not bother her, if you two are in a serious relationship.
ask her, "what is up with that?"
maybe ask if they would like to go on a date sometime soon.
look me up if you ever decide to visit florida.
those were great times.
she's concerned only about herself. no, that should not occur on a primary outing.
do you honestly want to spend your life with someone you argue with all the time?
if he comes to his senses, great. if not, then leave him.
you are too precious for those people.
attack him because he is interested in someone else?
it depends on the age, do they use cds or dvds?
you are twenty years old, you can start all over again.
i would like to visit the usa, what are things i will need?
if there is anyone who has any ideas, tips or just general information please email me.
you seem like a very lovely person, so do not let some of these women get you down.
if you go out and enjoy yourself, have fun and do not keep looking, a girlfriend will come along.
he is getting married, stop pursuing it.
is it similar to a clear liquid that turns yellow when it dries?
if there is a short messaging system in your country, that you can get on your cell phone, then try finding a text-mate.
when she starts to close her eyes, lean in, and kiss her on her lips. then the rest is up to you.
please be honest with me, i can handle the truth.
most importantly, have fun and never get so comfortable that you know what is going to happen next.
doing that shows how much they care about you.
you should tell her that you miss and love her.
some ideas are to get coffee or lunch, sight-see, walk and talk, play in the park, visit a museum, or attend a movie matinee.
if what you want is a hooker, you can find one in any part of the world.
now we do all of these things together. i don't know what i should do.
because if it fails you will be in a lot of trouble.
also, for me at least, it has been the best thing.
if they actually apply, try using some of these.
the issue is that he did the worst thing that he could have done by cheating on me recently.
unless he is treating you badly, she should be happy that you are happy.
women like it when men are thoughtful.
he may call you back if you give him space.
tell him you are looking to keep it casual.
they will think you are leering if you look at them creepily.
i am not certain whether he loves you, but he definitely likes you.
if a man really respects you, then he will understand.
think about whether you can really afford it and, if you want to, then go forward.
because he is the type of superhero who most closely resembles an average guy.
in some cases the problems are worth it if the good outweighs the bad.
i do not think it is wise to date at work.
that is stupid because you need a theory class for that.
let it take course from there.
about what they think about gay marriage/relationships?
so of course i had to ask him if he was ignoring me.
men will find you attractive regardless with this, generally.
however, i do not think that, by having intercourse with him, he will become unfaithful or leave you.
the safest rules of internet dating are: first, chat via e-mail and messenger; second, speak on the phone.
marriage is truly about trusting and communicating.
i had a similar problem as well.
it would depend on what you have kissed.
it would depend on whether you could trust him previosly.
you should make sure that getting your point across does not result in her hating you.
where have you been meeting this filipinos?
could you imagine if it was only considered love?
that way, you are not exactly telling them what you specifically do not like about them.
if he is, then go for it!
then, see if she is open for a dinner and a movie.
hello, i am sorry but i do not know and i wish the best of luck to the both of you!
however, i find him looking at me every now and then.
this is sin. we have started this.
entertainment includes eating meals, though not breakfast, if you understand me.
make a kind move. if there is no response, then you know what to do.
allow him to approach you. if you initiate anything, you will seem obsessed with him.
you people do not have the right to get married.
my tragic love story was that i loved him very much and he loved me as well.
you seem desperate and you will never find someone by acting desperate.
however, he insists that we are only friends.
looks do not really matter unless you are attempting to prove something.
i know once you have had sex with him, he is not longer a good friend.
the fact that a guy is so self-centered is a huge turn-off for me.
do not rush it. feel all of your emotions come alive.
its a two way street until you get them, then you will know which one.
so you have one baby out of wedlock?
i know i'm overly picky about people, how can i stop?
it hurts, a lot, maybe some girls might say that's it.
i'm going to jump that boy, is that the right choice?
it was a good idea.
it is not a turn off if she drinks too much.
some women will send men tiny messages without saying anything clearly.
i would prefer it if they left me alone.
you can ask her to go do something she is interested in, or see a movie that she would like.
you are a man, though i use the term lightly.
it is unfortunate that it is not automatic as with msn and aol.
that is how they will react to it. it is a bad situation for you and him.
return to that person immediately, before it becomes too late for you.
i also want to cause that person to stop smiling.
and, ask if he desires to dance with you.
then, she might state, "that looks ugly. i think blue looks better."
implore him to go visit a doctor.
i never accompnaied him a second time.
first of all, why did you break up?
why wait? go forth and execute it.
as long as he does not mind, who else's opinion matters?
i believe i am quite enraptured with him.
i never desired to have intercourse again.
the most important thing is to not attempt revenge on the one who wronged you.
if you must ask other people, then i do not believe you are ready.
i am a woman and i say those things.
a large area for savings is flowers.
time will tell. allow six months to pass and see what happens.
either that or you are the only one who will have sex with him.
from your list, i would choose spiderman.
i was cheated on for three of the years i was in a relationship.
all seniors think freshman girls are loose. it is sad, but true.
if he says, "yes," then you can tell him.
impress her with love and affection.
if you have experienced it, what was it like?
celebrate valentine's day with indulgence, give each other gifts, and have a good time.
any women standing beside unattractive men will appear attractive.
when i moved into the home, my neighbor asked me on a date.
you should approach him because he is obviously timid.
merely on a harsher scale as time passes.
be genuine. ask after their life and you may receive a response.
there have been many time you loved this guy but are not sure he feels the same way.
if you want a gift for your husband, i would suggest sports things or vehicle tools.
i like it, but i ran away.
i will pay if i can get your vote for best answer.
what size breats do most men like?
many twenty-two-year-old women are in relationships with twenty-seven-year-old men, so the twenty-two-year-old men feel insecure and search for younger women.
without lust as in you only go on dates, correct?
they probably know, because you cannot hide that very well, but you should tell your parents.
i will declare you the princess of planet kripton.
my previous girlfriend's boyfriend did that to her and she remained with him.
my friend has a boyfriend who she speaks to online and on the telephone.
do you enjoy fake nails or manicured nails?
speak with her, girls desire to hear the truth, good luck.
we can rough house and be the best of friends.
stay faithful to your husband, after all, he is the one that you said i do to...
do not listen to these fools with all of there poppycock.
yes, i am a man, so i do not really have to pay.
remember: not bird has ever flown on a single wing!
just let her know how you feel.
it depends, if you honestly love him, you will likely think you will want to elongate it.
if you and the other person is married, run from the situation.
no, men do not, but younger boys, do.
help me win the debate with her.
my girlfriend is a bit crazy, but i love her, anyway.
it is simple enough. do the same as anyone else and play with it.
my friend, allow him to leave. if he is intended to be with you then he will return to you.
as you might expect, after three days of that my back was injured.
you need to stay alive, and get your life back.
do guys know what they want in a relationship?
you can ask him to lunch or a movie.
girls to not guys who are self absorbed.
do you like either one?
i continually chose jerks, when i was looking for a partner.
so no, i feel it is a choice, and one does what feels comfortable to them.
some do and some do not have it in them.
do whatever makes you happy!
for some reason, i cannot.
therefore, there is no alternative to the proper labeling of "love."
due to...as you're aware...attempt to look for your beloved...however, use caution!
avoid requesting a performance of any given portion; cast her in the spotlight role.
young females are basically struck by a person's ability to demonstrate a bit of concern, truth and respectfulness to them.
inform the miscreant of his require to vacate.
they think it is the right way.
i wish you luck.
you need to figure yourself out if you want to stay married to him.
i dislike him for that reason.
men like this become violent to their wifes if they do not obey them.
first, i have four children and being a homemaker is more work than my job.
i have not because i prefer men who look normal.
it appears that he likes you, and should should show him how you feel.
people today seem to be so open and fast-moving with most people
i sometimes reveal details about my problems too early in a relationship, and perhaps i told that man too much.
the right date can save money on many things.
if you truly love your man and want the relationship to work, then you must tell your ex to respect that.
that only makes her easier to potentially sleep with.
do not think you should try it!
simple. honesty and love, try to be true with them.
i was hoping for at least a 90%, but realistically i think it is going to be more like 65%-70%.
cuddling up with a large woman is one the best feelings i know of.
women expect men to act that way, so why should they grow up?
there area couple of ways. one of those would be to get him inebriated.
the problem is whether you are going to ask her out while at work or not.
remain with thirteen and fourteen year old men, they are easier to control. good luck.
you should never allow a man to mistreat you.
by the way, i am not the kind of woman who enjoys a romantic dinner at home.
when i divorced him, i swore i would never again get married.
phrases to initiate a romance are tawdry. be genuine and compliment her often. women like that.
you will be fine. enjoy yourself.
not always. men occasionally shave them. it depends on the woman.
i love him but i think i am ready to move on and meet new guys.
so wait for another four years.
i hope to see some of it soon.
i do not intend to be mean.
and you should wait a while before having children.
i would like to have some fun with you. that is why i answered this dimwitted question.
attempt to contact their question and answer team. they will assist you with the process. enjoy your day!
because women do not yield frequently.
if he insists then it indicates sex is his only goal.
option b: appearance certainly matters. anyone who claims otherwise is most likely being dishonest.
making love is similar to living in a fantasy.
they said something they do not mean.
try to make it yourself when possible.
there is always something else.
she is not into you anymore.
i seriously doubt that you are in love with that number of men.
on average, i would say that 45% in the beginning, and approximately, 15% once you get to know the person.
play sports with you male friends.
she will tell you if it is not good.
i did not mean, "do you think that women are seductive and beautiful?"
how do i get him to stop nagging me and leave me alone?
an intimate toy, so that you can both enjoy it.
in my opinion, men without hair look like little boys, and it is not seductive at all.
i agree that should just osculate him, he will respond one way or another.
a good way to try is to imagine yourself without him or her.
in america, it's not as important.
if it was previously to you, then he hadn't commited adultery.
multiple times i have passed on a great opportunity by concerning myself about someone else.
caucasian women are appropriating all the men!
your self image is as well very important.
have you ever had a pap smear?
how old are you?
i believe they both like me.
well, the first thing sounds as if you guys are already married.
yes, jaime is going to ask rubi to go on a date. but, it is not your business.
that is a sign. things like that can make it obvious.
you should take the time to get know both of them equally without going on dates with them.
i would love to hear your logical opinion on this, thank you.
if you like the man, then go for it.
having fun with guy friends is okay.
therefore it is natural for that man.
women accept a lot and sometimes they feel as though they do it for no reason.
no, because i am not yet married.
tell me your opinion. thank you.
if you are homosexual, then act like it.
good luck and hang in there.
i like older women so i think it is wrong that they cannot go out with her.
i am just curious about what everyone thinks.
i met my last boyfriend driving around a roundabout in another car.
because, if you do, you will lose your friend over a man.
it was truly a casual aside when i said it; i did not think he would remember.
are you a young woman from a rural environment or from an urban environment?
spend all day together and, to top it off, touch his feet.
i am quite bored with being single and observing while other women have all the fun.
all women are curious about sex, even with other women.
i'm unaware what you stated, because i was too lethargic to read your typing.
i dislike it myself. i adore the straight items.
i am "doc izzy" and i love and adore larger women.
there are not any words that will make things any better.
you need to do it before it is too late.
well, to be honest, you will learn but you need to actually do it.
navy pier or one of the museums are great places, and there are a lot of great restaurants in hotels.
that is a cliche (not the farm girl type, i should mention) also, i believe i am sexually appealing in a manner suiting myself.
he will most certainly refrain from rejecting your request.
well, i'm hoping you'll review this information very thoroughly.
a large number of males appreciate heavyset women; they are primarily african american.
should she express any interest, she'll phone at a future time.
no, you will not since you're cognizant of his inclination to be unfaithful.
inquire of yourself regarding the topic at hand, if you comprehend my intention.
i've discovered if i employ a concerted effort, i'm able to visualize a reality that i'm aware is not typically present.
let us purchase coffee and converse and proceed from that point!
simply proceed in your existence and locate an alternative person!
if you email me, i will give you my honest opinion.
we have been dating off and on since last year.
i care about you, and i can not stop thinking about you.
it is worth the wait when you are ready.
if you so not know, ask someone who has the answer.
hide your fears and tell him.
that is a risk that you are going to have to take.
if you are interested in being attracted to unsavory people, by all means, drink.
it is only for looking at it.
after a long time it passes and i still love him.
it is your own life as you said.
even now in divorce i am stuck with it.
just because he has the potential to be a great boyfriend does not mean he is.
sure, let me know more about you.
when one minute you want to throttle the other person and the next you want to have sex.
the women that are pretty, or a great personality.
people whose parents take good care of them may become lazy adults.
i do not know what she wants.
it is complicated. try to tell the story again and make it simple?
show her some of your talents.
can you imagine starting a family with him?
if you're not confident enough to ask, someone else may ask instead.
this is why i am single.
if you love him, then you would let him go.
if she does not want to be in a relationship with you, then be her best friend.
if he says he is not, then believe him.
let us get it out of an unanswered state.
i worked there for awhile and met a man who i love.
i've been with my husband for 4 years, we got married in december of 2005.
focus on how things are and what would be best for you right now.
you will see that no matter how hurt you are it's still the simplest reason why you smile.
wow, i didn't think pakistan is that conservative.
i have to stop right away because i'm ready to relieve myself.
by all means, do not utter those words prematurely.
we don't know if she is sincere.
i don't want a man who does that.
then you make an easy decision.
i have sent sexual message to many girls.
he played a good game of basketball.
talk to your best friend and make sure they are ok with it.
is this a trick question?
is there anything i can do about it?
people choose to be husbands and wives for reasons.
if he does not then there are too many other options to tolerate that.
or is it merely that you would like to say that?
if you are not happy, fix it or get out.
not all men, but some do.
i agree with udaman, good luck.
it sounds like you enjoy selling yourself too much.
your girlfriend will think you are a jerk.
sometimes, but you have to observe the one you call your boyfriend.
replaying everything you ever did to me?
do not simply sit around and wait for the phone to ring.
i dated a man last year, and he got violent.
leave it alone. i do not care what she says, she is in enough pain.
how would anyone know if in fact they knew nothing about you?
find the one who loves you also.
it does not hurt to be flirtatious.
we were meeting up.
it is a turn off if you use pick up lines.
i do not have to ask anyone to the dance because i am a guy.
are there more guys then you think that love bigger girls?
a girl is ungrateful is she whines that flowers do not last.
you have found your true love and you need to be with them.
you need to really be her friend.
how do i get my partner to show me he loves me.
you need to stop talking to him and thinking about him.
they never met, but she says they are in love.
do not do this over the phone, email, etc.
i am not against homosexuals, they are the best friends i have.
i met a woman, and i want to know how to decipher if she likes me, or not.
death is similar to a box full of candy corn.
simply attempt to make the best of what is to occur.
either you progress with your life, or you attempt to coerce it to work with this person.
she is the love of my life, and i cannot wait to spend the rest of my life with her.
women use their brains.
i still love my ex; and, i am mad at my cousin because my ex likes her.
only time will tell, as such, spend time with friends and have fun.
i try to avoid chat rooms unless i need a good laugh.
i do not think i should have done that.
i do not know where to start.
because he cheated, i can either stay or leave my husband.
tell her to only call you regarding important measures.
that's all i have to say about the matter.
you should not be asking this question.
i was also thinking about going with lime green.
i am referring to both of you together.
i have a female friend that i am close with.
they want to be something they are not?
if you can, imagine yourself in bed with him at night!
they enjoy the challenge. that is what i love about it.
depends on the woman. black hair amplifies pale skin on a woman.
i should try this when i am dating in the future.
don't listen to what everyone else is saying.
i really like this man, but i can't tell if it is just a crush or if i truly love him.
i think that the bomb will be much easier.
it isn't always so easy, but there have been some great years.
do not forget to choose and vote for the best answer.
you inform her as to why you favor her.
is homosexual, or is it simply curiosity?
no, not if you must ask.
the list could go on forever.
but he might enjoy the waiting, dreaming, and teasing.
do not eat where you defecate.
of course if you want to chat, email me at fla_cat_blue@yahoo.com
when he teases you about trivial things.
if you think he feels the same way about you, then why not?
well, in my experience, one of them usually ends up cheating on the other.
often, they are worse than men!
i have heard of friends getting married just six months after meeting someone.
i do not know what you mean.
if you want children, then be a homemaker.
what is the worst that could happen?
a woman that is intelligent is a turn-on.
his or her intelligence, the way they carry themselves, good looks, and how active they are plays major factors in attraction.
sure and will you pay mine also?
all i can say is, "i have long black hair and i am proud."
i was not going to let her come in first.
chances are, if you appreciate her as your friend, then you will probably admire her as more than that.
when you are with her, just be yourself.
guys seem to think they are special, and good enough for certain girls.
you need to find someone you like ask ask them to be your valentine.
you can post more questioins on yahoo! answers.
if a boy picks on you, why would you like him?
i like the movie brokeback mountain. it might be a guy, but you will be happy.
size, shape, and overall looks should not matter at all!
sexual intercourse is not the only thing important in life!
you are probably just too good for him, anyway.
are you or are you not attracted to him?
why do you not simply inquire if you may kiss her?
who is able to determine if rural women feel more sexually attractive?
i am not aware of your age, which would be helpful.
simply consider what you enjoy and reciprocate in kind, similar to a tongue massage.
here is my answer: choice a. most men certainly do not prefer women that are extremely thin.
cut your cousin and ex out of your life.
do they mock you when you are with him?
it is possible to give pleasure rather than receive it.
i keep thinking about sex with her.
are they a brunette or not?
is she trying to use you?
you can be big, but bad in bed.
you need to get rid of the ex boyfriend if you are dating the guy you love.
it hurt very badly and i bled.
cuddling, kissing, fondling, and playing with each others sexual organs before sex is important.
when he does, explain to him that it was a mistake to break up and that you want him back.
my boyfriend loves me to death and does not want to give me up.
why bother if you are already doing it?
we participated in coitus on the hood of my car in the light rain.
i think you're probably very nice, and she probably loves you a lot.
you're looking too hard, or maybe in the wrong places. sign up for something like yahoo personals.
only if you want to do it.
if she doesn't have a reason, then maybe she isn't your friend.
you have to figure out what is comfortable for you and your partner.
you are definitely not a promiscuous woman, do not worry.
girls do not think it is cool. they think it is men who smoke are deplorable because they are killing themselves.
so do you like asian food?
they did not mean to get them pregnant, they just cannot keep it in there pants because they are degenerates.
i like real women, i do not like faux looking prudish drama queens.
take on how the world works, and their desire to catch up.
that is too many, and indeed selfish. you are just desperate, keep on trying, okay?
it is similar to eating chocolate and then complain you look fat.
do you know that he loves you?
my wife forgives me for many things.
first you order one online and then the stork delivers one to you.
i would estimate approximately three or four.
imagine that i am that boy and be my girlfriend.
give them a chance to know the real you.
yes it is unusual but it is nothing bad.
i still love him and i do not know what to do.
do not stay with him only because of the baby.
be sure to never ignore her, listen to her, and do not change the subject.
it is good luck if you believe it is.
it in a mans ego.
it sounds like you are going through a lot right now.
good luck, but remember to do your homework.
don't go to the place, it seems suspicious.
just ask a woman walking by, they are everywhere in thailand.
this woman doesn't want a man who deceives her.
i want to be content.
you are so full of it. shame on you for teasing all of these desperate, lonely, and sad men!
in addition, men sometimes think that they do not need you that badly until you are gone.
good luck is all i can say!
hopefully, you married your husband because you love him.
i love to use poems to express my feelings to women. has anyone written a poem for a special someone?
why would you want to commit yourself to just one man?
that is, if you both agreed on doing this.
it is similar to saying, "what can stop me after i have already done it?"
he just has to start over and try to earn your trust again.
i met ______'s (insert name) father from his side of our family.
why are we in a relationship if our partner treats us badly after we fall in love?
i am a person who wants to wait for sexual intercourse until i am totally in love with someone.
you should try being nice first. girls do not like being ignored.
keeping secrets only hurts those you love.
some women like big, hairy guys. some guys like heavy women. some girls like skinny guys, and vice-versa.
curves, especially if they have a large chest and art soft. you cannot beat a soft woman.
never tell her she is fat!
you are a mother, act like one.
others like to believe due to the way society dictates it. i believe we should rebel against society and appreciate curvier women.
give them two months and they will get over you.
i don't know, but user daniel k, has never even read manga.
i think it could be nice, it is your father's blessing.
i like intelligent, but attractive women.
come to my town, and i'll be with you.
this generation is too stupid.
yes, it is time to cash in your chips.
they are always in the "in love" stage.
whenever i see a malaysia air advertisement on television, i get capricious.
the way he asked me out, was very ingratiating
first, try talking to her, then ask her to go out as friends, and see where it goes from there.
this is very hard because there are a lot of temptations out there.
do not become what you are not simply because she says to.
the two of you should talk privately. you have to clear each other's side of the story up, now.
well, the one i enjoyed goes like this.
do not try to have sex.
keep it calm and a little hard to get. i may help.
if your relationship survives, you should be ready.
i married my guy. do you know why?
you need to move on and find someone who does not hate you.
we can just assume so.
we like pretty, good smelling flowers
should i, or should i not? younger guy versus older woman.
alright, those other replies are simply arrogant. i am way more attractive!
lime green would be more appropriate for a summer wedding.
however, let them get married if they cannot control themselves.
my boyfriend snores and i have a horrible time sleeping.
you may not think so, but the answer is yes.
we have no room in our society for crazy monsters like this.
the best and easiest way is to fly or drive to las vegas and get married there.
i believe his answer is good enough for me.
no man gave give you everything you want.
if he does not act right, then leave him.
if you're attractive, why not?
many men are similar to that, searching for sex.
i mess up often. she never forgets.
await for him to ask you out. unless you're very desperate.
are you asking if i like you?
make sure that your decision is your own.
you can't fix the relationship with her parents, but you may be able to fix the relationship with her friends. why do you ask?
how inebriated is this woman going to get?
men love women with a positive self-image.
i am doing this just for the points.
if you two do not know anything about each other then you cannot connect.
if you do, then i would say that it was a real relationship and completely worth it. good luck.
however, if you are used to it and enjoy it somewhat, go along with it.
it is because it is buy one, take one.
last but not least, does he always happen to be staring?
it sounds as though it might be illegitimate, however i can confirm that women enjoy it.
you have only met the foolish ones who believe thin is better.
in my opinion, there is a large difference between "having intercourse" and "making love."
you simply must force yourself to leave.
in my situation, probably 80%.
lean in and give me a soft kiss just on my forehead.
i cannot see my life without my husband.
i do think that it is much more attractive and smooth as silk.
flowers are really pleasurable, even is they do not last.
is sounds like he may be having too much excitement while you are away.
why don't you just leave the girl alone?
perhaps you should try dating girls if guys offend you.
i do not have a single girl friend.
just remember, go for guys that are themselves and only themselves!
they feel that they are better than women but they are wrong.
that does not meant that you should let them in.
it is always in the back of my mind.
does she have other friends she can talk with on the telephone?
getting married and having a child can wait, but studies can not.
however, you will need to do this a few times.
most teen-aged boys prefer teen girls like enjoy fornication.
enjoy the friends that you have and do not look back.
what is your personal belief on this matter?
i do not know what i should do.
it is a bad habit.
you will not loose your charm by 25.
my best friend does not like my boyfriend and wants me to break up with him.
we like it when you relax.
i do not believe so. perhaps, they should try taking our last names.
you both should pick either his or yours, once you have children.
of course, he wants to go on.
so, i suppose i pick domestic goddess.
ask her out on a date after school.
life is too short. live life to the fullest, and have faith.
i am man. i feel so as well.
if you are attracted to him that much, call him.
start with a simple question and move on from there.
you should tell more people; my boy did.
all that my friends want to do is to kiss all the time.
as well as asking if you are a good kisser and actually kissing.
i am at your service anytime and we will not regret it.
you need to replace it. add it back in just as it was the first time.
you can share this with your mother or father.
and do not believe the "alcoholic only on the weekends" excuse that the previous man is attempting to use.
you have exposed yourself to rejection, unless you are fairly well acquainted with him.
i prefer a and b cups, personally.
become her friend first and then see where that leads.
do not even listen to what any person says, watch the way that they act.
do you feel that way?
however if a boy asks you, do not be afraid to tell him no.
obviously she does not want you if you are aware that she likes the other boy.
there are plenty of things that make a woman not like sex.
not all guys get apathetic and move on.
but there is no better person to marry someday than your best friend.
it depends on what you are looking for.
i did this with my current boyfriend.
however, it does not mean you cannot love another.
simply divorce him, since he has no honor and does not love you.
basically, men are only interested in romantic relationships for the physical aspects.
if nothing works, you should ask him for it again.
it is your personal life, remain with it. whether or not a man goes on a date with you should not determine how you behave.
you must search within your thoughts for this one.
if the man is worthy, then you will not need to.
i am confused. i hate for the woman to be like that. what should i do?
shop around for the party supplies.
he then asked me if i could come with you.
if you like her so much, then just go with your feelings.
i am only myself around men that i do not like, and you know how that ends.
i hope you find a gracious woman.
i have adored this one woman since i was in ninth grade.
to all my fellow women at cone, a big, "hi," and a hug.
there is a reason she likes him.
if going to the movies is special for you two, then do that.
it sounds like you are the alpha in the relationship.
have you told her it is irritating with her checking up on you everyday?
it is for the same reason that thin women prefer slender, toned men.
he gave me his cell phone and asked me to enter my number.
go to hawaii (i am laughing) or pay someone.
i do not understand why people consider that it is wrong.
keep searching for someone who believes in romance because she is out there.
if you plan on cheating on your wife, you are not an honorable man.
he already knows that you like him. has he said anything negative about it?
confront him and ask him, then you will know.
it is more of a trust issue, i would say.
never stop trying to impress her.
no, you are punished. no television for a month.
i think this is better than the one on top of me.
that did not bother me because we are just friends.
go to school. you can still come home, or call your family and friends.
wow. go with the one that picks on you, because nine times out of ten, he likes you.
i had always felt the same way, but my views changed when i met my true love!
take baths, and learn how to speak?
i am attracted to him, and he says things like, "if i were not dating, then i would go out with you."
just get rid of him and you will be better off.
the one time in your life to truly live out the fantasy of true love.
people asked me, "what is the hurry?"
has he just broke him up with a woman and left before?
needless to say, i am 36 and am still in therapy for it.
for goodness sake, do not be a controlling person.
did you ever think of that question?
is it normal to still have feelings for him after six months?
you should look for a man who is attractive.
she is a very sweet girl, just the person you are looking for!
is there a reason that you are not with the baby's father?
no it is not cool, and you are simply destroying your health when girls hate it.
anything bigger than a handful is a waste, so probably a size c or d.
i think that they do.
stop trying to flaunt it in everyones face.
you should probably be looking when public place where you are the most comfortable.
a man asked me, "do you mind if we cuddle?"
ask about the score of the game.
some couples never get to that comfortable, laid-back stage.
i always say that you should do not do something if you are going to regret it later.
even the day after would be okay.
well, all you are missing is a million dollar smile.
i understand you fountian, the same thing happened to me.
although, i do not like women all too much.
be nice, make eye contact, and smile often. i hope this helps!
i would wonder why he shaved them, but in the end, they are his legs!
best of luck to you both.
this is just what i have heard many times.
i like only natural things. faux is not my first choice.
she needs to be ten years younger, who want a more mature woman?
ask your best friend, if it would be alright.
many people will tell you, "no!"
downtown houston just about any weekend, there are lots of clubs there.
who said women don't feel anything?
and don't start with her looks, mister!
if they have moved on, then you should also.
flirt with him and see how he responds.
i am waiting until marriage but wondering what constitutes going too far.
there is nothing wrong with her taking your telephone number.
you do not have to act overly happy or hyperactive.
i do not want to randomly approach someone and ask them to go out with me.
his attempts to make it up to you will be enjoyable.
you give at least five minutes of kissing, hugging, and cuddling.
i cannot help anymore unless i have more information.
because i say no avatars.
some women prefer gifts that will last.
he is probably wondering if you are interested in him at all, so flirt back.
i feel funny and happy.
if you are promiscuous then he is also, but i personally do not think you are.
so there are some guys that only say the l word if they mean it.
i do not need a trophy girl; i want a companion.
as a guy, let me say this.
be confident and always believe in yourself. do not be arrogant, always make good eye contact, and listen to what she has to say.
then he asked, "do you want some of my chapstick?".
there is not a wrong or right way to kiss.
we love them. it is not until later when we think about it, and about what was done before.
i would not know, i have the same issue.
what was the mistake that you did?
it is like breaking a drug habit.
tell him, and it would not seem crazy because you have known each other for a long time.
for the first answer that girl answered for me.
what about blue and green?
a life of your own is a life that you would be missing out on
i think that you are right, it is confusing.
the thing is that you do not have to ask her out to go out with her.
maybe he is going to call you.
be polite when you tell her.
i lost my virginity at sixteen.
i think all men like big breasts.
be proud of yourself.
can you do anything else besides work and fix things?
we do not know what you look like.
if you could have four qualities in your girlfriend, what would they be?
search the internet. you will find many things for the wedding, or in your local newspaper or news.
if she sits on your best friend's lap because she is drunk, then yes, it is unappealing.
view my boyfriend by going to my 360.
one day, you will find a man who truly deserves you.
you and the erotic perfume that you wear.
if he is not and you are still not ready then do not be concerned with his opinion.
why do they want it to be state sanctioned?
and she still allows me to play with my trucks and watch cartoons.
you can still love him, but you need to move on.
find out if he is willing to go out of his way for you.
if anyone knows, please let me know.
i was never aware that life could be so good!
then he said that he would call me back.
choose the one you like the best.
take it off.
if you really love him, you will tell him.
who actually knows but i would absolutely love for that to be done to me.
what should i do to get noticed by her?
man, you have to just get the courage up and introduce yourself.
there are actually movies that i have not seen yet.
i believe it all depends on age and upbringing.
and that will be merely intercourse.
my boyfriend was my friend initially and it is very nice.
what does other people's opinions matter?
also, try receiving some blonde highlights.
i use art to vent a lot of my problems through. you have to find a way to just let it all out.
if she likes music, then you can make her a special compact disc or tape.
it could be, you just have to choose one and know why you chose that one.
do not worry what people will say.
i think a lot of woman like receiving flowers.
i can't explain, it has nothing to do with them looking young and vulnerable.
forget him, and date his brother instead.
yes, they are there, you just have to look.
you can purchase them at staples for $35.
your child will find it difficult enough growing up without a father.
my friends say that i am overly nice and i ought to tell them no.
my girlfriend will not tell me she loves me to my face.
the right relationship happened on its own.
you will look silly.
no, you shouldn't care. if you like him then stay with him.
i think you should be your true self, have self esteem and confidence.
anything that is not nailed down.
make it your top priority to see her if you really want to be with her that bad.
one of my best friends has a thing with my big sister a few months ago.
should i forget it and move on?
they are friends on the other hand, that is a different story.
yes, i think anyone does!
my cousin met with a strange pervert who, online, had said he was an attractive teenager.
no women i'm attracted to in my list, therefore i choose my neighbors spouse.
i have long black hair, i love it, as my husband does as well.
if you truly care for your family. everyone in your family will love you.
unseemly or pudgy, men take what women they can obtain.
it occurred mid river, while people were watching. it was hilarious!
it is all about eye contact.
it depends on the man. some men do not.
it allows us to believe that you may be a coward.
if you love him and he loves you, then he may want to disappoint his father.
yes, some men do it without considering the woman.
maybe she is not a difficult person because she is skinny.
it does sound a big girl-like.
if you want to enjoy it a bit, why not check out some restaurants, night clubs, gyms, etc.
a few good women are left, you simply have to look in the right places.
it is like everyone has gotten separated, eventually.
you win some and lose some; just take it with a grain of salt and be more careful next time.
happy birthday to you.
i just need someone to help me figure this out.
choose the one who treats you better.
i like a sixth grade boy too.
i do not go out with friends because if it ends then he might not be your friend.
stick yourself out there more, you have to do far more than eye contact.
do what is best for the two of you.
bad teeth, breath and body odor.
no one needs to know that information.
if i ask i will leave, stop the relationship, and move on with my life.
do not get the wrong impression about what i said.
i asked him if he still liked me. he said he does but does not act that way.
where am i going with this conversation?
keep finding her younger and younger men, as one ages, find a new one for her...
you know that is, if you did not play the guilt trip.
that does not mean that it makes it right, it means that it makes us human.
it is a wrong decision that cannot be undone!
practice by unwrapping starbursts with your tongue and tieing cherry stems with youru tongue.
did you see her looking at you?
i know three men i can do that with.
either ask her out or express your feelings toward her.
if he is an "on and off" type of guy, leave him.
if they do not, then you will have to get on with your life.
i have never been.
in my opinion you should compliment her, ask her name, act normal, and act smooth.
she calls him often.
how should i approach her and not be just another guy trying to proposition her.
wait a little while and then date, and that way you will enjoy it more.
someone who never acts mean just because she thinks it is cool when it is not.
you do not have any decision on your mind.
why should i hide it?
some men just do not like to dance.
she really is not your friend because she will not stop bothering you.
i wish i had heeded my friends' warnings.
after all that time, can you finally see that she just is not really interested?
do i want to be in love?
why do they want to be married?
that is a no-brainer. oh, and nice picture of george clooney on your profile! ha!
some women cannot seem to find men their own age attractive.
some do, but i would rather have a pair that was not too big.
it sounds like that you are both comfortable with things the way that they are now.
it is so sexy that it looks very nice on almost any girl.
sometimes it is better to be very good friends first to make sure that you are happy around each other.
anyway, my question is: will i always feel that way?
listen to faith hill's music. love ain't like that is a great example.
please do not ask that question if you do not want to become upset.
and the girlfriend should accept that, if she loves you.
i think it is attractive for a man to shave his legs.
i do not think it is the best thing for you all to still have contact with each other.
i like this boy name austin, and i've commissioned my friend claudia to see if he has any affection towards me.
you are suffocating your romance by asking such a ridiculous question, have you ever considered just enjoying each other's company instead?
he is going to manipulate you, trust me.
everyone is different in their preferences, but i don't believe anyone would like you.
that is incredible, maybe you can attempt a first move.
if he rejects you, he is not worth a relationship.
just approach her and start a conversation.
it is a good idea to always be honest. besides, not many men i know do not like being told that they are attractive.
men who are not as attractive and do not have as much money know that women will not chase after them.
just face him and ask if he wants to see a movie.
that is why they call it making love.
if you smile at him once in a while he will know.
most girls are polite enough to answer it.
i would do it because you sound like my best friend.
say, hi harold, when will we be going to dinner together?
i think most guys don't care, but it may depend on the guy.
it will work out if you want it to.
give it up, he doesn't want to dance.
i feel like the guy should be the one to make the first move.
without having a boyfriend that would be a bit promiscuous.
you should wait. accept my opinion as woman in the military and wait.
you never know, my friend. they never show affection except for when they want something.
i am 49 years of age and in search of a beautiful woman with whom to spend my time and there is the potential for more as well.
do you mean seem more sexually attractive?
navigate to deleted items and it should be there.
this must be a red flag of how this boy is. i wonder!
perhaps because your name is freakgirl, but if you reveal your face perhaps not, no resentment.
that would be very painful you know, trust me, i have been there and have done that!
do you love her in depth?
have fun asking your cellmate that question in jail!
no, the only time you will see an emotional man is when he is with his lady love!
yes, i have done it. it was a lot of fun!
got to let the person you are with know what you want.
of course, it would be crazy if she phoned five times a day about the subject!
wait for the one that appreciates you.
my mother books them all of the time. her email is: pat@alanatvl.com
besides, do you not think that he has enough to worry about.?
i have been dating a younger man.
men play at love to get sex, while women play at sex to get love.
after a while it has to be played out.
everyone, even if they do not admit it, likes to be told they are sexy.
yes, but it depends on the guy.
perhaps you think they look sexy when they run out onto the field.
you are too young to already discuss kissing.
i will probably tell her soon because she is my best friend. though any help would be appreciated.
before anyone gets hurt, i agree with the other person.
i am ready to move on, but i am still in love with him.
go out and try everything you couldn't do when you were in a relationship.
obviously, men aren't better.
what will happen if you ask him to be casual lovers?
you could play a "truth or dare" game together.
he sounds like he is a very manipulative, unkind person.
slow down the pace and maybe try foreplay.
death is like a big black bag full of drugs.
where do you live; you can practice kissing me.
no, you will not, my friend. i was married to someone completely inconsiderate.
it seems that you truly love her. there is no need to forget her.
inform him that you simply want to be friends and that you are very disappointed that he would behave so poorly.
it always finds a way to become public. simply avoid it.
gross, what is with the hair on the chest?
as for now, i believe he is angry, hurt, upset and moved on.
give your brother some money and tell him to leave!
no offense, but it kind of sounds like a girl's name, not to be disrespectful.
be cool and ask her on a date.
after you take her out to get to know her; you can go in for the kill and ask her out.
people do not like to be played with.
practice unwrapping starburst wrappers with your tongue because the girls love it.
i do not know; i just want the points.
that is not true. most girls are just discreet.
are you attractive looking?
i told him that it was too late. normally i would not mind getting flowers on occasion.
that is a strange way to put it.
why is it hard for men to say the word love?
just enjoy the age that you are and do not worry about all of this.
even though, i am only 18 years old, i like my partners to be any age up to 30.
i have a friend in a similar situation.
women are just as deviant, trust me.
you should not go out with a man because you feel the'necessity' to.
dude, what you are saying is she doesn
does it usually take about a year for both people to feel comfortable and bored?
probably because i knew all my former girlfriends were not right until i met my wife.
i believe it is fine, so long as you do not base your relationship on intercourse.
but some men would do that. why?
if you are an average man, then breast size should not matter.
stray away from men who cannot admit that they are interested in you.
yes, ask for permission. watch how fast she becomes violent with you.
my husband is with me for me.
my mother also has cancer, this is too personal for me.
be the best version of yourself, and if he is impressed he will talk to you.
you don't want to be with anyone, but that person.
why don't you start seeing other people, and see how he reacts?
is it okay to kiss on the first date?
men have issues with secrets.
i had someone get rude with me, because i was still dating.
so, how do i simply kiss him?
i am the maid of honor for my only sister, and i want it to be perfect.
unless, it is with the wrong man.
