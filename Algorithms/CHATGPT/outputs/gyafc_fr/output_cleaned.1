I'm saying you gotta be her real friend, you know?
Are you just asking that to be funny?
Guys act like they're in love just to hook up, while girls act like they're into hooking up just to get love.
I don't mean to be mean.
I'd say like 45% at first, but once you get to know them, maybe more like 15%.
Some women like, don't just come out and say what they mean to guys, you know? They drop hints and stuff instead of being straight up.
How about we grab some coffee, chat, and see where things go from there?
Also, it really bugs me when my dad is not happy.
You should totally ask him if you need to go see a doctor.
Feel free to ask more questions on Yahoo! Answers.
He's got a lot on his plate right now, so don't take it personally.
I don't think he'll cheat or dump you just because you're not having sex.
Am I gonna keep feeling like this forever?
But he might actually like all the waiting, daydreaming, and flirting.
I wanna give it another shot.
It just depends on the woman if some guys shave or not.
If you're really into this guy, just smile and be nice when you talk to him.
I'm not sure if he loves you, but he definitely has a thing for you.
I'd ask you out, but I live in Oregon and have no clue where you live.
Women are so complicated, you know?
I know I'm super picky about who I hang out with - how do I chill out about it?
That seems pretty girly.
Sometimes, if the pros are better than the cons, then the struggles are worth it.
If you both are cool with it, then we can make it happen.
Michelle, this one girl who probably wouldn't even be brought up, said she didn't believe in it.
So, what's the deal with you liking that guy who always gives you a hard time?
Plus, guys sometimes don't realize how much they need you until you're not around.
Hey, if a guy asks you, don't be afraid to say no.
Do I wanna be in love?
I just called it that. But why?
If you stare at them all weird, they'll totally think you're being creepy.
I reckon you're onto something, it's pretty confusing.
How can I get my partner to show me they love me?
If you really love them, that is.
Don't sell yourself, even if he's loaded.
You seem like a really cool person, don't let those women bring you down.
I don't know, but I know about another website I check out.
You gotta think about how many cocky women are out there, seriously.
Not being in a relationship might make it seem like you're a bit of a player.
He was like, "Do you wanna borrow my chapstick?"
Go ahead and say it, but only if you really mean it. And don't forget to hold her hands and look into her eyes.
Don't let a guy ever treat you badly.
No way, he's way too big and I'm way too weak.
Just let him know if he's down.
What mistake did you make?
The king has a song about this, and it's called 'Only Your Mother Loves You.'
Why are we even together if our partner is gonna treat us like crap after we've already caught feelings?
Have you been through it? What was it like?
It's no big deal if she drinks a lot.
If that's what you're into.
It's like kicking a bad habit.
Wow, I should totally do that the next time I go on a date.
What do you want, though?
It seems like you guys are cool with how things are going.
Don't let her take over your life, she'll just have to figure it out.
Don't stress if he doesn't want to hang out with you, there are plenty of other fish in the sea.
No dude is gonna give you everything you want.
If you wanna stay married, you gotta figure yourself out.
Hey, so like, let's start with a basic question and go from there.
Ask them if they wanna go with you to that place.
Just trust him and don't bring it up again.
I'm still trying to muster up the courage to give it a shot.
Find someone who loves you back.
If you come to my town, I can be your main squeeze.
Definitely keep your distance from that guy.
You can choose not to like any of them, but personally, I can't stand any of them, to be honest.
I'd say about three or four.
I have no idea. Would you be cool with something being shoved up your butt?
He's a total player and has been bragging about it to some young chicks.
I always knew none of my exes were the right one until I met my wife.
Don't even think about trying to have both of them at the same time.
There's more to life than just getting it on!
I've got a Yahoo email and that's all I need.
I love chowing down on some good food for a good time.
But he was kinda busy after that.
"Yo, we're just gonna hook up."
Don't go up to her and tell her you think she's hot.
It seems like you're dealing with a lot of stuff at the moment.
But you should probably ask a girl about the symptoms, because I'm a guy.
I always felt the same, but then I met my true love and everything changed!
Men are so dumb! Who even gets why they act the way they do?
If no one else works out, your best friend would be a great person to marry.
I don't wanna just come out of nowhere and be like, "Wanna go out with me?"
If you don't really know him, you're just setting yourself up to get hurt.
You gotta swap it out and put it back in the same way you did before.
If you believe in something personally, it's neither good nor bad.
They bug you all day long.
You gotta either go to Hawaii or fork over some cash.
Their smarts, confidence, looks, and energy levels are big factors in what makes someone attractive.
I can just stop giving a damn about him and act like he never meant anything to me.
Does it look like a clear liquid that turns yellow when it dries?
It's a total buzzkill if she's all over your best friend when she's wasted.
Well, if it was before he was with you, then he definitely wasn't cheating.
He was always trying to be in charge.
We can totally give ourselves the gift of determination.
You gotta wait at least two years before tying the knot with a guy.
Hey everyone at cone, sending hi and hugs to all my fellow girls!
When you're hanging out with her, just be you.
I have no clue what you're getting at.
Some guy asked if I was cool with snuggling up with him.
Why do some guys do that?
There are still some awesome women out there, you just gotta know where to find them.
You gotta either move on or figure things out with your partner.
Dude, seriously, how can you love someone you don't even talk to?
Find a girl who's got talent and looks good too.
Just because you're not promiscuous doesn't mean anything.
This is the only time in your life when you can really experience true love!
You gotta figure it out on your own.
Just give them a couple of months, and they'll be over you.
After a while, you won't be able to see the color.
He's probably wondering if you're into him.
If she's not into you anymore.
Don't worry, you're definitely not a promiscuous woman.
There's no way to make someone have romantic feelings for you.
You should totally break up and keep your options open.
Have you gotten a pap smear?
I can just say yeah and add that I'm proud and have long black hair.
I've got a buddy who's in the same boat.
I dunno, maybe you're just young.
Hey, I'm gonna keep my name on the down low, but I've been working with this person for years.
I don't get the question. Can someone just tell me the answer?
If you really love him, you gotta tell him.
If you really like her, just go with your gut feeling.
Consider if you can actually afford it and if you do, then go for it.
Get back to your old life so you don't kick the bucket.
Hey man, you're saying she wouldn't?
Don't use flirty talk; it's not cool.
Maybe some women would say it really stings.
Let him know what you really want. That's what was said, but nothing was done about it. Share your thoughts.
If I was pissed off, it would be way easier to pull off.
You should also just move on if they have.
You're in trouble, so no TV for you for a whole month.
Just let him know, it's not crazy or anything, you just gotta have known each other for a bit.
That's just how she is. You could give it a shot or just keep an eye out.
It's kind of confusing; can you break it down for me in simpler terms?
Let them see all the cool stuff you can do!
Unless it's with the wrong guy.
My boyfriend really loves me and doesn't want to lose me.
It doesn't matter if they're brunette or not.
After a bit, it's gotta be played out.
Everybody likes being told they're sexy, even if they won't admit it.
I love hitting up the clubs in downtown Houston for some dancing.
Good luck, but don't forget to do your homework!
I like the natural look better than wearing a ton of makeup.
If you're into the guy, go for it.
We just got divorced.
Can you believe someone said women don't have feelings?
Doing is better than saying.
I've been thinking about a medium pink color, but what should I pair it with?
Keep an eye out for a call, email, or any sign that he gives a damn.
Make sure you always pay attention to her, listen up, and don't switch topics.
He's the only one bringing in the cash until I finish college.
She'll let you know if it's not okay.
I don't really care either way.
Don't eat where you poop.
I'm trying to get some blonde highlights too.
Don't stress about him, just focus on your classes and your boyfriend.
Looking good definitely counts. If someone says otherwise, they're probably not telling the truth.
I don't think I should've done that.
Foreplay is super important and should last at least five minutes, no less.
What's a cool gift I can get for my brother-in-law's birthday?
Try to be real and don't show off.
Best of luck on your new adventure! I really hope everything goes smoothly for you!
If they don't, then you just gotta keep on living your life.
Your first kiss should be like, totally out of this world.
This is the best thing about family life, it's so beautiful.
Above all, just be real.
I know three dudes I can do that with.
You gotta let your parents know. You can't keep it a secret.
Hey, it's Dr. Izzy here! I'm a big fan of plus-size women, I think they're amazing!
It's totally fine to go for it if he's hitting on her.
Hang out with the guys who are either thirteen or fourteen.
Just let him know that you just want to be friends and that you're bummed about his thoughtless behavior.
That's awesome, it's like getting your dad's approval.
If you're not super desperate, just wait for him to make the first move and ask you out.
I'm really into this guy. I don't know if it's love or just a crush.
If he keeps pushing for it, it just shows that all he's after is getting laid.
I found out that if I really try, I can imagine a different reality than the one that usually exists.
I'd love to have some fun with you, which is why I responded to this silly question.
Do you feel like that?
Give your bro some cash and tell him he needs to bounce.
He might give you a ring.
You can totally picture your life without them, you know?
If you really wanna hang out with her that bad, then you gotta make it your number one priority.
I choose the domestic goddess.
Are you totally in love with her?
Guys get bored faster than girls.
You can totally save some cash on flowers.
I wanna go to the USA. What do I need to bring?
If you ain't happy, then you gotta do something about it or bounce.
Just 'cause he could be a good boyfriend doesn't mean he actually will be.
I think blue looks way better than that. She might not be into it, but that's just my opinion.
You can totally make a citizen's arrest.
Just 'cause you're packing doesn't mean you know how to use it in the bedroom.
Wow, it looks so pretty on just about any woman.
Guys have a problem with keeping secrets.
Yeah, it all depends on the guy.
People were asking me why I was in such a hurry.
They both don't give a damn about how you feel.
I see him every week at PSR, but I just can't bring myself to talk to him.
I don't really dig guys who act like that all the time.
I like guys who shave their legs.
Is he gay, or is he just curious?
I think they do.
That decision is totally messed up and there's no going back!
I popped my cherry in a park when I was sixteen.
They've never actually met, but she swears they're totally in love.
Go ahead and see if he wants to dance with you.
Just live it up and believe in yourself.
I'm not sure if you took a tumble, but I'm down to get it on.
He knows you're into him, so just go ahead and ask him out.
Don't let fear stop you, just go ahead and tell him.
I wouldn't drive for five hours just to hang out with someone unless I really, really liked her.
Does her friend wanna chat on the phone?
You gotta hang out and play some sports with your bros.
When you first fall in love, you feel so happy and excited just thinking about that person.
I can't imagine my life without my husband.
It's like we always end up pushing away the people we care about.
If you guys still feel the same when you're older, then just go for it.
Let her know, ladies like it when you keep it real. Good luck!
You gotta figure out if you wanna spend your whole life with someone you're always fighting with.
I don't really consider you much of a "man" when I talk about you.
Me, I like A and B cups.
Any chick looks hot next to an ugly dude.
I'm down to date someone ten years younger. Who's up for dating an older lady?
It happened to me, and now I'm dating that person.
Just tell me how you really feel about her.
Let her see your baby pics in the buff.
Why are gay people getting married?
We had sex on the hood of my car in the light rain.
Why should guys have to grow up if women want them to act like that?
You gotta do this a few times to get the hang of it.
Having sex is like living out a fantasy.
Right now, I reckon he's pretty pissed off, upset, and not really feeling like hanging out with you.
Hey, if you know the answer, just give me a shout.
Red symbolizes love, black symbolizes death, and all that jazz.
I prefer someone with a little bit of meat on their bones because I feel like I'm getting ripped off with someone who's too skinny.
If you don't know, just ask someone who knows.
He's gonna try to make it up to you in a fun way.
The person who teases you probably has a crush on you.
So, I've had a crush on this girl since ninth grade.
Did you catch her checking you out?
I had no idea life could be this amazing.
Okay, so I'm really into this guy, but I have no idea how he feels about me.
What's the best for both of you?
Well, at least she didn't give you a bogus number.
So, like, in my opinion, you're not promiscuous.
But if they can't control themselves, just let them get married.
She's always hitting him up.
Why even bother if you're already doing it?
You've loved a guy so many times, but never knew if he felt the same way about you.
Do you think I should dump him just because of his mom?
If you make a cool move and she doesn't respond, then she's just not into it.
I know some people who tie the knot after only 6 months of dating.
Be real. If you ask about their life, they might just tell you about it.
Show her what you can do.
You're gonna look ridiculous.
They've got their culture down pat.
If you don't ask, you'll always be left wondering.
What do you think? Thanks!
I'd say don't stress about it too much.
What's the worst thing that could happen?
I'm totally lost and have no idea what to do because I really don't want the girl to be like that.
You gotta find someone who doesn't hate you.
Don't be rude.
Nah, that's not true. Most girls are just low-key.
Some guys just don't feel like dancing.
This generation ain't too bright.
Do you have a kid? Are you hitched?
It all comes down to whether you could trust him before.
Unattractive and overweight dudes just settle for whatever they can get.
People decide to get married for all sorts of reasons.
It's not worth it to argue all the time.
Hope you enjoy asking your cell mate that question while you're in the slammer!
Are you trying to figure out if I'm into you?
What did ya smooch?
I'm curious about hooking up with other girls, and I know I'm not the only one!
It's cool if she's between twenty and thirty-two, and she doesn't have to be younger than you.
The idea is easy. Just be real and show them some love.
When that happens, it'll be easier for you to make a decision.
Cheesy pickup lines are lame. Just be real and make sure to give her lots of compliments. Chicks dig that.
He totally cheated, so I think that means I can totally lift or carry my husband.
Try to make the most of a crappy situation.
Are you trying to make some new friends?
I think he'd be an awesome Valentine.
This is tough because there are so many things tempting me.
Does it usually take like a year to start feeling comfortable or bored in a relationship?
It's all up to you whenever you're good to go.
Sure, I'd be down to meet some ladies.
That's just how things are.
It's cool to be friends with someone online, but you gotta set some boundaries.
Can you picture us starting a family together?
If he says no to your request, then he's not worth it anyway.
Honestly, you'll figure it out, but you gotta go through it.
I hope you married your husband because you love him.
So, it's up to the woman. What does she like?
I know there's someone waiting for me when I get home.
Take a break and treat yourself to a massage to escape from everything.
I have no idea where to begin.
So, are you a good-looking person with a fit body?
Are you talking about your avatar?
Why don't you guys just chill together all day and then finish it off with a foot rub for him?
If a guy is into you, he'll give you a ring.
If you keep acting like this, she might start thinking you're desperate.
I think there's a big difference between 'having sex' and 'making love.'
So, like, I have four kids, so I totally get that being a homemaker is way more work than my regular job.
You guys don't have to stay together just because you have a kid.
Are you a young woman from the country or the city?
You can always put off getting hitched and having kids, but you can't delay your studies.
I've never been to that.
Are you down to be with the same guy?
How often can you hook up with Pamela Anderson?
Just make sure she doesn't end up hating you when you try to get your point across.
This really hits home for me because my mom also has cancer.
I really dig running my fingers through curly hair.
I'm talking about both of you guys.
If you just chill and wait, the perfect lady will show up.
I want my wife to also grow.
He's clearly shy, maybe you should go for it.
The doctor was also really surprised.
If you both have a good time together, she'll probably be up for some wild sex with you.
Where do you stay? I could swing by and we could practice kissing.
You might think it's a no, but it's actually a yes.
Hey, no offense, but maybe it's because your username is 'freakgirl,' but if you were to show your face, it might change things.
Guys don't do that, only little dudes.
Hey, you think we should go out on a date sometime soon?
It happened to me, like, two times.
Don't go out with a guy just because you feel like you have to.
If you actually wanted to be with him, you wouldn't be asking.
I just hope it never goes through, man!
Most women are just waiting for a guy to spill his guts and tell them how he really feels.
Women get really into it during sex.
Keep trying to impress her all the time.
Leaning in and giving me a soft kiss on the forehead.
I'm not really like that, but I know a bunch of people who are.
She only cares about herself. Nah, that shouldn't happen on a first date.
Well, it all comes down to how much you're catching feelings for this guy!
Thanks in advance for the pep!
Why do they wanna get hitched?
We're cool with being approached gently, maybe with a little bit of pursuit.
Anyway, I ended up marrying my husband and I'm just curious if you know why besides love.
I wanna go to an amusement park or a museum.
I think I might be catching feelings for someone and I'm not sure if it's love.
Do you like fake nails or a nice manicure?
First, figure out what you want and don't stress about what everyone else wants.
Now we do all this stuff together. I have no idea what to do.
I don't get what you're saying.
I was like, "Do you still like me?" And he was all, "Yeah, but you wouldn't know it by the way I act."
I'm diggin' the scent of your perfume.
Try to unwrap Starburst candies with your tongue. It's something that women really like.
I reckon most guys don't give a damn, but it really just depends on the person.
It's not about being vulnerable, young, or submissive at all.
Don't tie the knot too soon in the relationship.
If you're thinking about cheating on your wife, that's not cool.
Just be yourself and if he's into it, he'll come talk to you.
You only wanna be with that person, nobody else.
He's tying the knot, so back off.
Did you tell her how annoying it is when she checks in with you every day?
When I moved in, my neighbor asked me out.
Most teenage guys prefer hooking up with teenage girls.
He killed it on the basketball court.
Don't stress.
Do you like to argue and fight?
If he was starting to like you more than her, he probably would've broken up with her to be with you.
The main thing is not to try to get back at the person who did you wrong.
This dude is totally down to travel for 21 hours and 1400 miles just to be with me.
Have you been to the doctor yet?
Maybe she's not a shrew, but that skinny lady definitely was.
You gotta get out there and live it up, don't be wasting my time.
It's like eating too much chocolate and then whining about gaining weight.
I went there and he was there too.
If he's single, go for it!
If you don't listen to guys like that, they usually end up being the type who hit their wives.
Do you like him or not?
If you're totally sure, then you should definitely let your parents know if you haven't already.
A lot of folks will likely give you the cold shoulder.
Do you think he feels the same way about you?
Some guys only say that word if they really mean it.
Seems like he's into you, so you should let him know how you feel.
I think everyone should just keep their own name.
Friends are always there for you, but guys can be so flaky.
Just picture it as love, you know?
I think you should always be prepared, even if your relationship lasts through all four seasons.
Okay, so some guys are into that kind of girl, while others aren't as into it.
If you wanna have kids, then just stay at home.
Is it a good idea for younger guys to date older women?
He's keen on keeping it going.
You gotta stay loyal to your husband. He's the one you made promises to.
So basically, you gotta label that 'love' properly, there's no other option.
Also, it's super important to have a good self-image.
I'm a girl and I say that stuff.
You gotta believe me, girls can be just as dirty-minded.
I like flowers, even though they don't stick around for very long.
I still haven't seen some movies.
She's a really sweet girl, exactly who you're looking for!
Maybe just think with your head instead of your heart, she might not be into you.
I don't mean any disrespect, but that totally sounds like a girl's name.
I wouldn't bother calling him back.
I don't have any women I'm into, so I'm going for my neighbor's wife.
Marriage is all about trust and talking things out.
Don't listen to what anyone else says.
How can I make things work with her?
Give them a rose and let them know you love them.
Yeah, it's weird, but it's not a big deal.
You gotta figure out what's right for both of you.
They can handle a man, but they're not as classy as we are.
Totally, especially when she got sick.
Because of...as you know...try to find your favorite...but be careful!
I can't help anymore without more info.
You can't really mess up or nail kissing.
Take your time to make a decision.
It's totally cool to hang out with your guy friends and have a good time.
Just think about the things you like and give back the same, like giving a tongue massage.
My partner was totally my buddy before anything else. It's like pure bliss.
I'd say it's more about not trusting them.
I need some help figuring this out.
If he's still not into you, just keep it moving.
He's probably not interested either.
Give it a shot and try to do it yourself whenever you can.
Can you do anything else other than work and fix stuff?
I was like, "I really, really love you."
It looks like all the older guys at school think that freshman girls are easy, which sucks.
Hey, how do I just kiss him?
If you look in the deleted items, it should be there.
I hope you find a cool girl to go out with.
I don't think that's a good idea, you're not there for that.
That list is super long.
I'd say Brokeback Mountain is a good one, you'll still enjoy it even if it's about two guys.
If you're not all about sex in your relationship, that's cool.
I'll probably tell her soon because she's my bestie. And, any help would be awesome.
Yep, it's bad luck to see the bride or groom before the wedding.
Hang in there, stay strong, and best of luck!
Just a small family gathering.
If you're not sure about how well it'll go, then just don't do it.
I'm hitched now.
I think it all comes down to how old you are and how you were raised.
Once you have kids, you gotta figure out what last name they're gonna have.
Your kid is gonna have a tough time growing up without a dad.
I just don't find bald guys attractive, they remind me of little kids.
You gotta give it a shot. If things don't work out and you break up, it's gonna be tough to stay friends.
Hey, do you know what the score was in the last game?
If you're seeing the guy you're crazy about, you gotta cut ties with your ex.
The easiest and best way is to just fly or drive to Vegas and tie the knot.
Sure, let's hang out and get to know each other better.
I like a size C or D. Anything bigger is just a waste.
Lie and make up more lies.
They haven't done it before and it's double the fun!
My wife ain't into wearing those fancy brands.
We don't know what you look like.
Opposites attract, so we always end up finding our life partner.
I reckon this is way better than my personal life.
Don't go anywhere with your new date that you used to go with your ex.
Chat with your bestie and see if they're cool with it.
It might sound weird, but it totally worked for me in like three to five days.
I don't like it when he gives you a hard time about the small stuff.
Nah, I'm not married yet.
A lot of guys dig curvy women, especially African American ones.
I love writing poems to express my feelings to women. Has anyone ever written one for their partner?
I told her I liked her before, and she was worried about messing up our friendship.
If you think he's cool, then just chill and hang out with him.
Do they make fun of you when you're with him?
I love those people because I'm a guy and I don't have to bring a date to the event.
If you're feeling this strongly about it, maybe getting married isn't the best idea.
It really just depends on whether or not someone is full of themselves.
You gotta move on and find someone who doesn't hate you to be with.
You gotta get to know her and eventually one of you will ask the other out.
I was like, "Are you ditching me or what?"
Maybe some rude dudes like hanging out with younger Asian girls.
Make sure you're the one making the call.
Let him know you're just looking to keep things chill.
Isn't he treating you right? You deserve to be happy.
This situation is really tough and has a ton of issues.
They've been pretty good years, not always a walk in the park.
We've been seeing each other every day for like four or five years.
Just picture me as the guy you're looking for and then let's go out.
Flirting a little never hurt nobody!
You gotta go with your gut feeling.
Good luck to you!
Is it like, bad if I haven't kissed the girl I've been with for eight months?
It's up to the lady to decide.
I think they look way better than a lot of other countries.
It'll be fine the next day.
Wanna see if she's free for dinner and a movie?
Some guys don't even consider their partner when they're getting busy.
Can you ask in English? I can't understand you.
Sorry, but I've never felt that way.
Hey, just so you know, no bird has ever attempted to fly with just one wing.
I think about this issue a lot.
You'll never find a partner if you're always looking so down in the dumps.
I recently met this girl and I'm wondering if she's into me.
Don't just sit there and wait for the phone to ring.
Shut up and love whoever you want!
Lots of 22-year-old women are dating 27-year-old men, which makes the 22-year-old guys feel insecure and look for younger women.
If he gets it together, awesome. If not, it's time to move on.
He might be into you, but he also might want to let his old man down.
If you say sorry to him for no reason, you'll just make a fool of yourself. Don't let yourself be a pushover!
You gotta do something before it's too late.
This lady ain't looking for a guy who's gonna lie to her.
I'd love to hear what a Black woman thinks about this topic.
Can you help me crush her in this debate?
Pretty much all of them are guys around your age, give or take. They're hardly ever not.
When are people gonna start realizing this?
I'm not sure what I should do.
You go to a bar and drink until you're totally wasted.
I acted like that around my current boo.
If you gotta ask, then that's a no-go.
Don't just sit around and wait for him to figure out that you're the one for him.
I'm getting divorced, but I'm still stuck with this.
You'll be good. Have fun!
Your girl will just think you're being a jerk.
You can't really mend things with her parents, but you might have a shot at fixing things with her friends. What's the deal?
I wouldn't marry a woman who won't give up her last name, but that's just me.
Maybe you should try hitting on younger women, since guys can be pretty rude.
I dated my ex for three years and then they went and cheated on me.
You'll figure it out eventually, but I suggest just waiting to see what happens for six months.
So, the one I liked was like this.
Not all guys dump their girl.
It's a blast going there, and there's tons of stuff to do.
Is it cool to kiss on the first date?
I'm tight with this girl I know.
They're totally into each other.
When he does, just tell him you want to be with him and that breaking up was a mistake.
My buddy keeps saying I'm too nice and need to start saying no.
But hey, there's always an exception, right?
Not all dudes, but some do.
So, you can still keep your last name.
Go up to her, say hi, and see if she's available.
That really turned me on, but I bolted.
Even if a girl is on the heavier side, she can still be attractive.
Not everyone here is taking classes.
Try practicing how to unwrap a Starburst and tie cherry stems with your tongue.
If you keep chatting with him for another week, he's gonna start thinking you're married or something.
I'll totally pay up if you give me your vote for best answer.
You gotta find a place in public where you'll feel totally at ease.
Try flirting with him and see how he responds.
It helps me out a lot to not have to stress about inviting someone.
Can you please go out with me?
She never lets me live down my mistakes.
How do I talk to her without her thinking I'm just some sketchy guy?
As a dude, I might have some thoughts on that.
Don't stress, you're just 13.
I always ride trails with someone else.
If you guys really love each other, you'll figure it out.
Making eye contact is super important.
I can totally pick him up.
He just needs to start from scratch and earn back your trust.
I dated my ex-boyfriend in second grade, fourth grade, and eighth grade.
What's the deal with wanting to ask her out?
Hey, I'm really counting on you to go over this info carefully.
Wanna play "truth or dare" together?
Just wait and see for yourself, then go with the flow.
That's dumb, you gotta take a theory class for that.
If you eat something like that, just call it quits.
I can't stop thinking about getting it on with her.
The only way you'll find out is if you just go up to him and ask.
Jamie's gonna ask Rubi out on a date.
You guys are still together because neither of you has the guts to break it off.
They might find it cool to learn about that.

Do guys really like bigger women?
He's into you too, but who knows what's gonna happen, only time will tell.
If a guy truly respects you, he'll get where you're coming from.
We've gone and started our own sins.
I'm good with his answer.
You can totally still love him, but you gotta move on.
An intelligent woman is really attractive.
I reckon it's not fair that they can't hang out with her.
When my sister kisses someone, she always closes her eyes to get ready.
I ran into my ex while I was driving in a roundabout.
But, he's actually tying the knot this month.
Should I just forget about this and move on?
Are you going over everything you did to me?
Looks like you guys are already hitched!
So, like, why didn't they just break up?
If you give him some space, he might hit you up later.
You gotta let more people know.
Just take it one step at a time. Think about how he lost something good.
Hey Harold, when are we gonna grab dinner?
Nah, don't even bother asking.
You gotta go to school, but you can still come home or hit up your friends and family.
I never wanted to have sex again.
Let him come to you. If you make the first move, you'll look too into him.
Some folks don't do that because of their faith.
You should be stoked with yourself!
I think it's a choice because people just do what they feel comfortable with.
You gotta think about that and it'll help you figure out if he's trustworthy or not!
I didn't mean to ask if you think women are hot and pretty.
See if they're gonna start getting aggressive.
It seems like you really love tooting your own horn.
Check if the dude you're into is down to go the extra mile for you.
But that doesn't mean you can't show each other some love.
If they don't know anything about you, how are they supposed to know?
Why should we care about what other people think?
What qualities would you want in your girlfriend? Like, if you could pick four.
Women dig it when guys are considerate.
I feel kinda silly, weird, and totally pumped.
Just chill out and play a little hard to get, it could work in your favor!
Check out how she struts her stuff.
He shouldn't give a damn if you're at a dance together.
Ladies dig guys who are confident.
Hit her up for another date after class.
You gotta schedule a session with a therapist!
I think I'm still totally in love with him.
That's cool, I'm happy to help out if you catch my drift.
Feel free to grab something that you can't shake off.
You've only met guys who are picky about their type.
But I'm not saying you have to be celibate until then.
Don't make him dance if he doesn't want to.
I'm a dude. I'll let you know what I know.
My girlfriend won't say she loves me to my face.
We can't really tell if she's being real or not.
Could you help me get to know her?
My hair is long and black, and me and my husband really love it.
Right now, most folks are making their decisions pretty fast.
Maybe they're trying to be something they're not?
No way, buddy. I was married to someone who was totally thoughtless.
You gotta steer clear of your dude friend.
I'm searching for a girl who's down to hang out with me.
For me, it's been the best thing ever.
I met this guy once, and it was like a total romance movie. We first crossed paths in the middle of this epic rainstorm.
If you're down to put in extra hours, you'll get paid extra too.
I'm wondering if things will ever be the same after that.
It's all good, just pick one and make sure you know why you picked it.
Gotta wait another four years.
I'm stoked that my hair is brown.
If you're looking for a gift for your hubby, I'd recommend some sports gear or car tools.
You can totally become something else.
The problem is that he totally screwed me over by cheating on me.
Just imagine yourself hanging out with him at night and see what happens!
It really hurt and I started bleeding.
It could mean a bunch of different stuff.
Being apart for ten years just sounds awesome.
You gotta do more than just look someone in the eye.
Do you wanna have all your friends around for the long haul?
I can't stand him because of how he acted.
I know what I want in a relationship, though.
It happened in the middle of the river, with people watching. It was so funny!
If you're hot, just flash him your boobs.
So, it's totally normal for that guy.
I get so stoked when I see a Malaysia Air ad on TV. It just makes my day!
Go ahead and do all the things you couldn't do when you were in a relationship.
It's totally possible to get more enjoyment out of giving pleasure than receiving it.
Is it like, totally normal to still be into him after six months?
If you start feeling it, just go back to the foreplay.
Guys will think you're hot no matter what, most of the time.
It's a real challenge.
Just grab any lady passing by, they're all over the place in Thailand.
It's super important to go for about thirty to forty-five minutes.
I'm worried because I really like him a lot.
It's like a buy one, get one free deal.
I had no idea Pakistan was so conservative.
Let's wrestle and become best buds.
I hardly ever see him at school, but I've spotted him at my brother's basketball games.
You didn't really tell us much. So, where do you all live?
You gotta fess up about why you're into her.
It's like they just don't vibe with you.
At some point, everyone's gotta go through a breakup.
I was there for a bit and met this guy who I'm totally in love with.
I'll probably go check it out.
Why the hold up? Just go ahead and do what you want.
Hey, just so you know, there are actually a lot of guys out there who really like bigger women, despite what you might think.
I didn't think he'd remember, I just said it casually.
Girls don't like guys who are all about themselves.
You gotta check it out.
You can use either a CD or a DVD, it's all good.
You guys are working really hard to get it right!
If she's into it, she'll give you a call later.
I really dig you and can't get you out of my head when we're not together.
Do you think I should give him another chance at some point?
If you feel like your love is fading, don't brush it off.
Daniel has never checked out a manga book.
If they actually work, give some of these a shot.
I've been in the same situation too.
Or does she just wanna hang out with other people?
Pick the one you like best.
Get ready to say goodbye to her.
I tend to spill the beans about my issues too soon in a relationship, and maybe I overshared with that guy.
I bet it's pretty normal, but I'd just go for it.
Just get rid of him, it's the better option.
Sometimes you gotta keep an eye on your partner.
If he gets them first, then you get the popcorn.
Who cares if it's just a rebound for both of you?
My girlfriend is the most passionate person I know, and I love her even more for it.
Someday, you'll come across a guy who really deserves you.
Stay strong and don't give up hope.
How about we go with blue and green instead?
Some guys do it, some don't.
I'm looking for a girl who's nice and smart.
It's not as bad as it could've been, at least it's not bella.
It's more like 65% or 70% instead of 90%.
What was the point of that?
I have no idea what she wants.
My bestie totally hates my partner and wants us to break up, but that's not gonna happen.
We were just hanging out for a bit.
You let go of like a thousand, at least.
All my friends wanna do is make out like crazy.
Happy b-day to you!
Girls think with their brains.
I think you should totally give her a compliment, ask for her name, and just be cool and smooth.
How long do we have to wait before we can say it's taking up too much time and she's not really into it?
Girls don't think it's cool. They think guys who smoke are lame because they're basically killing themselves.
I'm only my true self around guys I'm not into. You know how that goes.
The timing with the older dude just wasn't right, you'll see.
Take both of them out on a date.
I'm my sister's only maid-of-honor and I really want everything to be perfect.
I can never get a good night's sleep because my boyfriend snores like crazy!
If they don't get along, they shouldn't hang out. Who cares what they think?
If you don't tell her you want to be with her forever, you might have a better shot at making it happen.
Just let her know to only hit you up if it's something important.
I gotta go pee right now, I can't hold it in any longer.
I could totally start forgetting about you after like three days.
Or are you just trying to say that?
I'm cool with what the other person is saying, as long as nobody gets hurt.
People don't like being messed with like a yo-yo.
I'd totally be into that happening to me.
You can totally win her over with some love and affection.
Guys have a dong and gals have a clit.
By now, you should totally be head over heels for your wife after all the stuff you guys have been through.
I ain't looking for a high maintenance chick, I just want a partner.
I really hate it, but I love the straight variety.
If she really likes him, then there's a reason to do something.

That's weird, but maybe. I don't know. I'll talk to my friend later by his locker.
If you're just a regular person, boob size doesn't really make a difference.
I'm a guy, so I have feelings too.

I like smart, cool, and interesting women.
Awesome, that girl totally nailed the first question for me.
If they send a sexy pic, they're down to hook up.
Where have you been meeting these Filipino women?
Maybe you should just ask him to grab lunch or see a movie or something.
I haven't because I like guys who look regular.
I had someone get really mean with me just because I kept dating.
I'm totally into him, but I'm also ready to move on.
Sure, just make sure to ask for permission. You'll see how quickly she gets aggressive with you.
Guys think they're all that and believe only certain girls are up to their standards.
I'm down for some action every now and then.
I've heard this a bunch of times.
It seems like you're the top dog in the relationship.
Wait for someone who will appreciate you for who you are.
Hey, don't go to that place, it looks sketchy.
It's all about how it looks.
It's time to stop worrying about him. If you're meant to be, he'll come back to you.
The guy I like is mad at me.
Are you into Asian food?
My cousin met this weird older guy she found online who claimed to be a horny teenager.
If you're wondering, I haven't fallen in love.
Don't even bother listening to what anyone says, just watch how they act.
Don't let any guy tell you how to act, just be yourself.
I still love him, what do I do?
Just chat with your partner about the topic.
If you give him a little wink, there's no challenge at all.
You could also just tell her and have a fairy tale romance, if you want.
Are you killing the romance by asking that dumb question? Maybe we should do some fun stuff together instead.
Also, kissing and asking about your kissing skills.
Jules' sac is hilarious, but he can be a jerk too.
Can you spot my buddy?
In my opinion, when a guy is super self-absorbed, it just makes him way less attractive.
I know this because I'm kind of like your wife in terms of personality.
I don't think you're ready if you have to ask other people.
Rip off your shirt and scream like Tarzan!
If you don't love your husband anymore, then just move on and make space for someone new.
Make sure it's a real nice compliment about her.
I'm into this guy who's in 6th grade!
They get all weird around guys who aren't as educated.
How about we go on a date and see if we catch some feelings for each other?
If she snitches to the administration, I'll get kicked out because this is Pakistan, not America.
My buddy is dating someone they met online.
I love snuggling up with a big girl.
I think the bomb is way easier!
I met ______'s dad from his side of the family.
Anything that can't be easily moved.
Let's just be friends first and see where things go from there.
I got played for three years while I was in a relationship.
Why are you gonna go after him just because he's into someone else?
Don't tell them beforehand, just let them find out when you're in bed together.
It's not a big deal here in America.
Be sure to have confidence and trust in yourself. But don't get too cocky. And always make sure to keep good eye contact and really listen to what she's saying.
Just go with the flow.
I know because I've dated someone like that.
I wish I had listened to what my friends were saying.
If he acts up, just ditch him.
Do whatever floats your boat and brings you joy!
We tried to move on, but it just didn't work.
If you don't feel like asking, someone else might do it for you.
My twin won't even talk to me or listen to what I have to say.
She'll totally answer the question, because girls are usually polite.
You didn't marry him for no reason.
See if he wants to catch a movie with you.
Some women just can't find guys their age who are cute.
It doesn't matter because we're just friends.
If that ever happens, you should totally sign up for some self-defense classes.
It just seemed that way to me, you know?
How drunk is this lady gonna get?
You gotta get to know both of them before you decide to date either one.
He's totally into you, you know?
You can hop on into a community with live and webcam chat.
Man, those were some good times, I'm telling you.
If you're hooking up with a lot of people, then he's doing the same.
White women are taking all the guys!
I'd be totally nuts if she called me five times a day.
You might be the only one he can hook up with.
Let the troublemaker know he's gotta leave.
Wow, how old are you?
They think they can boss people around, but they really can't.
If you're into him, you'd totally let him go.
Someone I can just be myself around.
From here on out, it's smooth sailing!
Just tell them "I love you." You'll know everything you need to if they take their time saying it back.
I just got out of a three-year relationship with the father of my baby.
Good luck finding your perfect match!
I still love him, even though it's been a while.
Does he even know that you care about him? Has he mentioned anything?
Everyone has their own preferences when it comes to who they find attractive.
My wife is pretty chill and forgiving.
What do you think will go down if you ask him to be friends with benefits?
I'm into him and he's like, "If you were single, I'd totally date you."
Women can be even worse than men.
She might be trying to take advantage of you.
Please don't do anything that could hurt you.
You'd be so surprised to see the kind of people who are into him.
Wait until you're 25 to do it. Your appeal won't go down by then.
So, if that's what you're really into, then that's the way to go.
Do dudes even know what they want in a relationship?
If you're still hung up on your ex, you're gonna have a rough time.
But if you're used to it and kinda like it, just roll with it.
Don't forget, you're in it for the long haul - 'til death do us part!
It's totally cool for her to ask for your phone number.
If the answer is yes, then why do I keep hearing girls say that flowers won't last?
Don't be shallow and just judge her by her looks.
If you guys are in a serious relationship, it shouldn't be a big deal to ask her that question.
I'd go for Maui or the Bahamas.
Are you gonna ask her out at work or what?
He was so smooth when he asked me out.
You're being unfair with your double standards.
I can't really speak from a wife's perspective, but I hope my opinion still counts.
It's totally okay to feel let down and pissed off.
He got to his stop, so he hopped off the train.
Start from the beginning and then just keep going for 20 years.
Don't be scared to say, "no."
I don't give a damn about what she says, just let it go, she's already hurting enough.
If it doesn't work out, you can kiss your job goodbye.
You could give dancing at a club a shot.
I've missed out on some awesome chances because I was too worried about someone else.
How do I get him to quit bugging me?
When you're 18-20, you might say stuff you don't really mean.
I'm curious why he decided to shave his legs.
Be cool, make eye contact, and throw a smile.
What's everyone's take on this?
Hey guys, what size woman do you prefer?
She doesn't want you to only like her because she's pretty.
All I can say is, good luck!
I only told a girl I loved her and really meant it once.
If she's cool with it, then go grab them.
If you wanna be friends with her, chances are you want something more than just a casual friendship.
If you keep hiding stuff, you're gonna end up hurting the people who care about you.
Just be yourself and show some confidence. That's what women, well, most women, are into. But the most important thing is just being yourself.
Don't stress about what other people say.
Most guys who say they would probably aren't being totally real with themselves.
Just forget about him and go out with his brother instead.
Dying is like a whole box of candy corn. It'll rot your teeth.
I wouldn't want a pair that huge.
I think society tells us to think a certain way, but I say we should go against the grain and celebrate women with curves.
It just makes it easier to have sex with her.
Give him a ring if you're really feeling that spark with him.
You can't make the decision because you don't have any power over it.
It's your life, so do whatever you want.
As you get older, just keep on snagging those younger guys to make yourself feel good.
Just so you know, I'm not really into having a romantic dinner at home.
I'm just doing this to rack up some points.
You're gonna have to take that risk.
Work on your relationship, but don't let him keep you cooped up at home.
Don't rush to give him advice, no matter what you decide to do.
It's probably not a good idea to date people you work with.
If you guys love going to the movies together, definitely make it a date night!
It happens after 'threeplay' and before 'fiveplay.'
Get a sex toy that you both will have fun with.
Man, ego is just something we all gotta deal with.
I'm with you on that, dude.
I really dig him, but I wanna convince him, not turn him down.
I'm not really thinking about him, but he keeps popping up in my dreams.
He probably won't find another girl for a while.
You gotta go out and meet some new people to date.
Don't do anything you'll regret later.
When it comes to online dating, it's best to start off by chatting through email and on the phone for safety.

You're probably done looking for the guys who really admire you.
You'll find your perfect match, Mrs. Right.
If you can fart in front of each other, then you know you're meant to be together.
I'm hoping to see some of it real soon.
Just go up to her and start talking.
Sorry, I don't know how old you are, and that would be helpful to know.
Yeah, that's not a good habit.
We don't have space for crazy monsters like this in our society.
Did you mean, "seems more spicy?"
Is this question trying to trick me?
It's like saying, "What's gonna stop me now that I've already done it?"
Picking the right date can totally save you a bunch of cash.
That's all I gotta say about that.
Why do guys find it so tough to say "I love you"?
If she really loves you, then your girl should be cool with it.
Then he was like, "Can I come with you?"
A lot of guys just want to get laid.
That's usually because of a spasm in the back.
They oughta give our last names a shot.
You're gonna lose your friend because of some guy.
You'll totally be able to tell if he's into you!
I'm stoked that they're into the challenge.
Create a playlist for her or burn her a CD.
I wanna be happy.
Don't try to have sex.
Sometimes when I'm dating someone, I get really embarrassed.
When you're ready, it's totally worth waiting for.
You're way too special for those folks.
So, does this mean he's into me?
I think the guy should make the first move in a relationship.
If I could, I'd totally keep my last name.
You gotta ditch the bad stuff and keep it moving.
Check in on him every now and then and see how he's doing.
Try out new activities to meet new people.

Navy Pier and the museums are awesome to check out. Plus, there are tons of amazing restaurants and hotels nearby.
One of them is always sneaking around behind the other's back.

My mom always books our trips through 'pat@alanatvl.com' - she's the best at finding good deals!
It's been over six months and I just can't seem to get over it.
She's gotta move to Massachusetts.
It doesn't really matter, but I'm cool with just a few.
Some ladies like gifts that won't go bad and will stick around for a while.
She's tough, caring, and not as happy as she thought she was.
If you're into sixth graders, then you must be pretty young.
It doesn't matter at all what size, shape, or looks something has on the outside.
Are you wondering what they think about gay relationships?
Sure, just give him a kiss and he'll tell you what he thinks.
He handed me his phone so I could add my number.
If you wanna have a good time, maybe hit up some nightclubs, restaurants, or gyms.
So, I'd say they do pull it off, but not very often. Hope that helps!
If you're in Florida, hit me up.
Why don't you just ask her out?
Sorry, I don't know. Good luck to both of you!
Hey, I'm thinking about coming to your country.
Look for another hot girl to make her feel jealous.
If you don't wanna get upset, just don't ask that question.
I don't know what to do because she knows how much I care about him.
And does he always seem to be staring?
You gotta give foreplay a shot, it helps to take things slow.
Fair-skinned ladies tend to look even paler when they rock black hair.
I wasn't gonna let her come in first.
Don't ever say she's fat.
Wanna hear a lame joke?
You know it would suck if you didn't play "the guilt trip."
It looks like he's having a blast while you're not around.
Yeah, I totally think anyone would.
Some couples just ain't ever gonna be that chill with each other.
It's pretty clear that guys aren't really any better.
I never went on another date with that guy.
Maybe it's because you're the hottest girl they've ever seen.
You've found your soulmate and you gotta be with them.
If the guy is legit, you won't have to prove anything.
You're too young to be talking about kissing already.
Just order one online and a magical stork will deliver it to you.
It gets harder as time goes on.
Just keep doing your thing and find someone else!

I can't remember ever giving a girl a Christmas present unless I really liked her.
Who can tell if country gals feel sexier?
I ran into mine at a carnival.
My hubby thinks I'm pretty cool.
She ain't no liar.
If they don't do it, then it's time to keep going.
Figure out what kind of arrangements and flowers you want.
If he's cool with it, who else has a relevant viewpoint?
You're probably way too good for him.
She's cool with me tinkering with my trucks and chilling with some cartoons.
Lime green is like, totally a summer wedding color.
Can I do anything about it?
The perfect relationship just kinda happened on its own.
Looks don't really matter unless you're trying to show off or something.
Just tell me the truth, I can take it.
You could kick off the day by grabbing breakfast somewhere and then going for a leisurely stroll.
I totally messed up and accidentally deleted my friend, and he was so mad at me.
Don't have sex.
Make sure you're nice when you talk to her.
Whenever you guys feel like it, go ahead and kiss.
Ask her questions (but don't just chat).
I think you're a good dude. She probably really digs you.
If she calls, just shoot her a text back.
No way, that's totally not cool. You're just messing up your health because women really don't like it.
