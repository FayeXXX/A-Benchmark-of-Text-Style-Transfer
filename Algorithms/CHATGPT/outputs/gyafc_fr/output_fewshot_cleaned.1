You gotta really be her friend, you know what I mean?
Are you just asking for the sake of asking?
Guys fake love to get laid, girls fake enjoying sex to get love.
I don't mean to be rude.
i'd say like 45% at first but once you get to know them, maybe like 15%.
Some women drop hints instead of just saying what they want to men.
Let's grab some coffee and chat and see where it goes from there!
also, i hate it when my dad is not happy.
Hit him up and ask if you should go see a doc.
You can ask more questions on Yahoo! Answers.
He's got a lot on his plate right now, so don't take it personally.
but i don't think he'll cheat or leave you just because you're not having sex.
'Am I gonna feel like this forever?'
But he might actually dig all the waiting, daydreaming, and flirting.
also, i wanna give it another shot.
Some guys shave, it just depends on the girl.
If you're really into this guy, just smile and be nice when you talk to him.
I'm not sure if he loves you, but he definitely likes you for sure.
I'd ask you out but I live in Oregon and have no clue where you live. Hit me up if you're nearby!
Chicks are so complicated, man.
I'm so picky about who I hang out with, how do I chill out about it?
That seems kinda girly.
sometimes, if the good is more than the bad, then the struggles are worth it.
that's if both of you are down for it.
Michelle, this one chick, said she doesn't believe in it.
So, why do you like the guy who always teases you?
Also, guys sometimes don't realize how much they need you until you're not around.
If a guy asks you, don't be afraid to say no.
Do I wanna be in love?
That's what I called it. But why though?
They'll think you're being creepy if you stare at them like that.
i think you're right, it's confusing.
How do I get my boo to show me some love?
that's if you really love them.
Don't sell yourself, even if he's loaded.
You seem like a really nice person, so don't let those women bring you down.
I don't know, but I know another website I check out.
You gotta think about how many overly confident women there are, seriously.
Not being in a relationship might make it seem a bit promiscuous. Just saying.
He asked if I wanted to borrow his chapstick.
You can say it, but only if you mean it. And make sure to hold her hands and gaze into her eyes.
You should never let a guy treat you badly.
No way, he's way too big and I'm way too skinny.
You can let him know if he says yeah.
What mistake did you get involved in?
King has a song about this, it's called 'Only Your Mom Loves You.'
Why are we even in a relationship if our partner starts treating us like crap after we've fallen for them?
If you've been through it, how was it?
It's no big deal if she drinks a lot.
If that's what you want, go for it!
It's like kicking a drug habit.
Wow, I gotta do that next time I'm dating.
What do you want, though?
It seems like you guys are cool with how things are going.
Don't let her take over your life, she'll just have to deal with it.
If he doesn't go out with you, don't stress, there are plenty of other fish in the sea.
No dude can give you everything you want.
If you wanna stay married, you gotta find yourself.
What's the plan for tonight? Let me know if you figure it out.
Ask them if they wanna go with you to that place.
Just trust him and don't bring it up again, okay?
I'm still trying to muster up the courage to give it a shot.
Find someone who loves you back.
'i'll be your bae if you come to my town.'
Stay way clear of that dude.
It's up to you if you don't like any of them, but I can't stand any of them, to be honest.
I'd say around three or four.
i have no idea. would you like something shoved up your butt?
He's a player and he's been bragging about it to some young girls.
I knew none of my exes were the one until I met my wife.
Don't even think about trying to have both of them at the same time, okay?
Sex isn't the only thing that matters in life!
i have a yahoo email and that's good enough for me.
For me, fun is all about chowing down on some good food.
but he was kinda busy after that.
It's just gonna be sex.
Don't go up to her and tell her you think she's hot.
Sounds like you're dealing with a lot of stuff at the moment.
You should ask a girl about the symptoms, I'm a guy lol.
I always felt the same, but then I met my true love and everything changed!
Guys are so dumb! Who can even figure out what they're doing?
Your BFF is the best option to tie the knot with if no one else pans out.
I don't wanna just go up and be like, "Wanna hang out with me?"
If you don't know him well, you're just setting yourself up to get hurt.
You gotta swap it out, then just put it back in, like you did before.
If you believe in something personally, it's not necessarily good or bad. Just your own thing, you know?
they bug you all day long.
Either go to Hawaii or shell out some cash.
Their smarts, confidence, looks, and energy levels are all big factors in what makes someone attractive.
I can just stop caring about him and forget about him like he never even mattered to me.
Is it like a clear liquid that turns yellow when it dries? Just curious.
It's a total buzzkill if she's all over your bestie when she's wasted.
Well, if it was before he was with you, then obviously he wasn't being unfaithful at all.
He's such a control freak.
We can totally give ourselves the gift of determination.
You should only tie the knot after being with a guy for at least two years.
Hey ladies at Cone, sending you all hi and hugs!
When you're with her, just be you.
i have no clue what you're trying to say, tbh.
A guy asked if I'd be cool with cuddling with him.
why do some guys do that?
There are still a few good women out there, you just gotta know where to look.
You gotta either move on or figure it out with your partner.
Chill out, how can you love someone you don't even talk to?
Find a talented girl who's also cute.
Just because you do that doesn't mean you're a player.
This is the only time in your life when you can experience real love!
You gotta figure it out on your own.
Give them 2 months and they'll be over you.
After a while, the color will fade away.
He probs wants to know if you're into him.
If she's not into you anymore.
You're totally not a promiscuous chick, so don't stress.
There's no way to make someone fall in love with you, unfortunately.
You should totally break up and keep your options open, you know?
Have you had a pap smear yet?
I can just say yes and add that I'm proud and have long black hair, lol.
i have a buddy going through the same thing.
I dunno, maybe you're young.
Hey, I'm gonna keep my name on the down low, but I've been working with this person for years.
I don't get the question. Can someone just tell me the answer? Thanks!
If you really love him, you gotta tell him.
If you really like her, just go with your gut.
Consider if you can really afford it and if you do, then go for it!
Get back to your old life so you can keep on living.
Yo, what you're saying is she isn't coming?
Don't use flirty talk, it's not attractive.
maybe some ladies would be like, "ouch, that really hurts."
Let him know what you really want. That's what I told him, but he hasn't done anything about it. Share your thoughts.
If I were mad, it'd be easier to do.
You should also move on if they have, too.
You're in trouble, no TV for a whole month!
Just tell him, it won't seem crazy, we've known each other for a while.
That's just how she is. You could try it that way or just keep an eye out.
This is so confusing; can you explain it again in simpler words?
Let them see all your skills and give them a shot to discover what you've got.
unless it's with the wrong guy.
My boyfriend loves me a lot and doesn't want to lose me.
The only thing that matters is if they're a brunette or not.
After a while, it's gotta be played out.
everyone, even if they won't say it, loves being told they're hot.
i like hitting up the clubs in downtown Houston for some dancing.
Good luck, but don't forget to do your homework!
i like the natural look, not a ton of makeup.
If you're into the guy, go for it.
We just got divorced.
someone said women don't have feelings? smh
Actions speak louder than words, yo.
I've been thinking about a mid-level pink shade, but what should I pair it with?
Keep an eye out for if he calls, emails, or even gives a damn.
Make sure you never ignore her, listen up, and don't switch topics.
He's my only cash flow until I finish college.
she'll let you know if it's not okay.
I don't think I care, either way.
Don't eat where you poop.
trying to get some blonde highlights too.
Don't stress about him, focus on your classes and your man.
Looks definitely matter. If someone says otherwise, they're probably lying.
I don't think I should have done that, tbh.
Foreplay is crucial and should go on for at least five minutes, no less.
What's a cool gift I can give my brother-in-law for his birthday?
Just be yourself and don't try to show off.
Good luck on your new adventure! I hope everything goes smoothly for you!
If they don't, then you'll just have to keep on living your life.
Your first kiss should be out of this world.
This is the best part of family life, no doubt.
'Just be real, that's the key.'
I know 3 dudes I can do that with.
You gotta tell your parents. Can't hide it.
Hey, it's Dr. Izzy here. I'm a big fan of plus-size women, love and adore them!
It's cool to jump on him if he's hitting on her.
Hang out with the guys who are 13 or 14.
Just tell him you wanna be friends and that you're bummed about his thoughtless moves.
that's good, it's like getting your dad's approval.
Don't be too eager, just wait for him to ask you out.
i'm really into this guy. not sure if it's love or just a crush.
If he keeps pushing it, then it shows that all he's after is sex.
I found out that if I really try, I can imagine a reality that I know isn't usually there.
i'd love to have some fun with you, that's why i responded to this silly question.
Do you feel like that?
Give your bro some cash and tell him he needs to bounce.
Maybe he'll give you a ring.
You can totally picture your life without them.
If you really wanna hang out with her that bad, then you gotta make it your number one priority.
i'm choosing the domestic goddess.
Do you really love her?
Guys get bored faster than girls do.
You can save some cash on flowers.
i wanna visit the USA. what do i need to bring?
If you ain't happy, then you gotta fix it or bounce.
Just because he could be a good boyfriend doesn't mean he will be.
She might think that looks ugly, but I think blue looks way better.
You can totally make a citizen's arrest.
Just because you're packing doesn't mean you're a pro in the sack.
Yeah, it looks super gorgeous on pretty much any woman.
Dudes have problems with keeping secrets.
"Yep, it all depends on the guy."
People were asking me why I was in such a hurry.
They both don't give a damn about how you feel.
Even though I see him every week at PSR, I can't muster up the courage to talk to him.
i don't find a guy attractive when he acts like that all the time.
i like guys who shave their legs.
Is he gay, or is he just curious?
I think they do.
That decision is a total fail and there's no going back!
i lost my v-card in a park when i was sixteen.
They've never met in person but she swears they're in love.
Ask him if he wants to dance with you.
Live life to the max and believe in yourself!
I don't know if you fell, but I wanna hook up.
He knows you're into him, so just go ahead and ask him out.
Scare him off and give him the heads up.
I wouldn't drive for 5 hours just to hang out with someone unless I really, really liked her.
Does her friend wanna chat on the phone?
You should totally play sports with your bros.
When you first fall in love, you feel so happy and excited just thinking about that person.
i can't imagine my life without my hubby.
We always seem to push away the people we love.
If you both still feel the same when you're older, then go for it!
Let her know, ladies like hearing the truth. Good luck!
You gotta decide if you wanna spend your life with someone you're always fighting with.
You're barely a "man" in my book, lol.
Me personally, I like A and B cups.
Any girl looks hot next to an ugly dude.
i'd totally date someone 10 years younger. who's up for dating an older lady?
It happened to me, and now I'm dating that person.
Just keep it real about how you feel about her.
Show her your baby nudes.
why do gay people wanna get married?
We hooked up on the hood of my car in the light rain.
Why should guys grow up if women want them to act like that?
You gotta do this a few times to get the hang of it.
Getting it on is like living out a dream.
Right now, I think he's mad, bummed, and not wanting to be around you.
if anyone knows the answer, holler at me.
Red is love, black is death, and all that jazz.
i like someone with a little meat on their bones because thin people make me feel like I got ripped off.
If you don't know, just ask someone who does.
He'll make it up to you in a fun way.
The person who picks on you probably has a crush on you.
okay, so I've had a crush on this girl since 9th grade.
'yo, did you peep her checking you out?'
i never knew life could be so amazing!
Okay, so I'm totally crushing on this guy and I have no clue how he feels about me.
what's best for both of y'all?
At least she didn't give you a bogus number.
So, like, in my opinion, you're not promiscuous.
Let them tie the knot if they can't keep it together.
She's always hitting him up.
Why even bother if you're already doing it?
You've loved a guy so many times, but never knew if he felt the same way about you.
Should I dump him because of his mom?
Make a good move, and if she doesn't respond, she's not into it.
i have friends who get hitched after only 6 months of dating.
Just be real. Ask how they're doing and you might get an answer.
Show her what you got.
You're gonna look silly.
that culture totally has it right.
If you don't ask, you'll always be left wondering.
What's your opinion? Thanks!
Don't stress about it too much, I'd say.
What's the worst that could happen?
'i'm so confused and don't know what to do because i hate seeing the girl like that.'
You gotta find someone who doesn't hate you.
Don't be rude, okay?
Nah, that's not true. Most girls are just low-key.
Some guys just don't feel like dancing.
This generation ain't too bright.
Do you have a kid? Are you hitched?
It all depends on whether you could trust him before.
Ugly and fat guys just settle for whatever they can get.
People decide to get married for all sorts of reasons, ya know?
It ain't worth it if all you do is argue.
Enjoy your time in the slammer asking your bunkmate that question.
Are you wondering if I'm into you?
What did you smooch?
Chicks are always curious about hooking up with other chicks, and I'm no exception!
20-32 is cool and she doesn't have to be younger than you.
Just keep it simple. Be honest and show them some love.
When that happens, it'll be easier for you to decide.
Pick-up lines are cheesy. Just be real and give her compliments all the time. Chicks dig that.
He cheated, but I think that means I can pick up my husband.
Try to make the most of a crappy situation.
'You looking for a friend?'
i think he'd be an awesome valentine.
This is tough because there are so many temptations.
How long does it usually take to feel comfortable or bored in a relationship?
It's all up to you whenever you're ready.
Sure, I'd be down to meet some ladies.
It's just how things are, ya know?
It's cool to be friends with someone online, but there gotta be boundaries.
Can you picture starting a family with him?
If he says no to your request, then he's not worth it anyway.
Honestly, you'll figure it out, but you gotta go through it.
Hopefully, you married your husband because you're in love with him.
So, it's up to the woman. What does she like?
I know I've got someone waiting for me when I get home.
Take a break and treat yourself to a massage, you deserve it!
i have no idea where to begin lol
So, are you a hot, fit person?
"Is that your avatar you're talking about?"
You can chill together all day and then finish it off by giving him a foot rub.
if a guy is into you, he'll give you a ring.
If you keep acting like this, she might start thinking you're desperate.
imo, there's a big diff between 'having sex' and 'making love.'
First off, I have four kids, so I know being a homemaker is way more work than my real job.
You don't have to stick together, even if you have a kid.
Are you a young woman from the country or the city?
You can delay getting married and having kids, but you can't put off your studies.
i've never been to that.
Do you wanna be with the same guy?
How often can you hook up with Pamela Anderson?
Make sure she doesn't end up hating you when you try to get your point across.
This hits too close to home for me, my mom also has cancer. It's really tough.
i love running my fingers through curly hair.
i'm talking about both of you together.
The right woman will come along if you just chill and wait.
I want my wife to also grow.
He's obviously shy, maybe you should go for it.
the doc was like, totally surprised too.
If you have fun with both of them at the same time, she'll probably end up having wild sex with you.
Where do you live? I could swing by and we could practice kissing.
You might think it's a no, but it's actually a yes!
No offense, but maybe if you actually showed your face, it wouldn't be because your name is 'freakgirl'. Just saying.
Grown men don't do that, only little boys do.
Maybe see if they wanna hang out sometime soon?
It happened to me, like, twice.
Don't go out with a guy just because you feel like you have to.
You wouldn't be asking if you actually wanted to be with him.
and I just hope it never goes away!
Most women are just waiting for a guy to spill his guts and tell them how he really feels.
Chicks get really into it during sex.
Keep trying to impress her non-stop.
Give me a little kiss on the forehead, leaning in towards me.
I'm not that kind of person, but I know plenty of people who are.
She only cares about herself. Nah, that shouldn't happen on a first date.
Alright, it all depends on how much you're catching feelings for this guy!
Thanks in advance for the pep! Appreciate it!
Why do they wanna get hitched?
We like it when you come at us gently, maybe with a little bit of pursuit.
So, I ended up marrying my husband, and I'm curious if you know why besides love.
i wanna go to an amusement park or a museum.
'i think i'm catching feelings for someone and i'm not sure if it's love or what lol'
Do you like fake nails or a nice manicure?
First, figure out what you want and don't stress about what everyone else wants.
Now we do all these things together. I'm not sure what to do.
i don't get what you're saying.
i asked him if he still liked me and he said he does, but he doesn't act like it.
i like the perfume you're wearing.
Practice unwrapping Starburst candies with your tongue. Chicks dig it.
i think most guys don't give a damn, but it really just depends on the person.
It's not about being vulnerable, young, or submissive. Just saying.
Don't tie the knot so soon in the relationship.
you're not a good person if you're gonna cheat on your wife.
Be the best you can be, and if he's impressed, he'll hit you up.
You only wanna be with that person, no one else.
He's tying the knot, so just drop it.
Did you tell her how annoying it is when she checks in with you every day?
When I moved in, my neighbor asked me out.
Most teen guys prefer hooking up with teen girls.
He killed it on the basketball court.
Don't worry about it.
Do you like to argue and fight?
If he started liking you instead of her, he probably would've ended things with her to be with you.
The most important thing is not to try to get back at the person who did you wrong.
One dude is down to move 21 hours and 1400 miles just to be with me.
Have you gone to the doctor yet?
Maybe she's not a shrew, but that skinny lady definitely was.
You should get out there and live life instead of wasting my time.
It's like eating too much chocolate and then whining about gaining weight.
'i went there and he was there too.'
If he's single, go for it! Go get him, girl!
If you don't listen to guys like that, they usually end up being the ones who hit their wives.
Do you like him or not?
If you're sure, then you should definitely tell your parents if you haven't already.
A lot of folks will likely turn you down.
Do you think he feels the same way about you?
Some guys only say that word if they really mean it, you know?
It looks like he's into you, so you should let him know how you feel.
i think everyone should just keep their own name, you know?
Friends are forever, but guys are always coming and going.
try to picture it as love, maybe?
You gotta be ready even if your relationship lasts through all four seasons, ya know?
Okay, so some guys are into that kind of girl, while others not so much.
If you want kids, then just stay at home.
Younger dudes and older ladies, good idea or nah?
He wants to keep going.
You gotta stay loyal to your hubby. He's the one you promised to love forever.
So, there's just no other way to label 'love' correctly.
'Also, how you see yourself is super important.'
i say that stuff and i'm a girl.
Believe me, girls can be just as dirty.
Flowers are cool, even if they don't last forever.
There are still movies I haven't watched yet.
She's a super sweet girl, exactly who you're searching for!
Try using your head and not your ego, maybe she just doesn't love you.
No disrespect, but that totally sounds like a girl's name.
i wouldn't bother calling him back.
No hot ladies on my list, so I'm going for the neighbor's wife.
Marriage is all about trust and talking to each other.
Don't listen to anyone else's advice, okay?
What do I gotta do to be successful with her?
Give them a rose and show them how much you love them.
It's weird, I know, but it's not a big deal.
You gotta figure out what's right for both of you.
They're woman enough for a man, but they ain't as classy as us.
She was really sick, especially when she got ill.
'cuz of...as you know...try to find your boo...but be careful!
i can't help anymore without more info.
Kissing is something you can't mess up or nail.
Take your time to make a decision.
Chilling with the bros is totally cool.
Just think about what you like and do the same for me, like giving a tongue massage.
My partner was totally my buddy before anything else. It's like pure bliss.
I'd say it's more about trust, you know?
i need someone to help me figure this out.
If he still doesn't like you, just move on.
he probs isn't interested either tbh.
Please try to do it on your own as much as you can.
Can you do anything else besides work and fix stuff?
i told her i really loved her.
It seems like all the older guys think freshman girls are easy, which sucks.
So, how do I just kiss him?
If you look in the deleted items, it should be there.
I hope you find a cool girl to date!
I don't think that's a good idea, you're not there for that.
That list is super long.
I'd say Brokeback Mountain; you'll be stoked even if it's a dude.
If you don't make sex the foundation of your relationship, it's all good.
I'll probably let her know soon because she's my BFF. Any help would be awesome, thanks!
It's bad luck to see the bride and groom at the wedding.
Hang in there, stay strong, and good luck!
Just a small family gathering.
If you're not sure about how it'll go, just don't do it.
'i'm hitched now.'
i think it all depends on how old you are and how you were raised.
Once you have kids, you gotta figure out what last name to give them.
Your kid is gonna have a tough time growing up without a dad.
bald guys look like kids to me, not my type.
Give it a shot. If you end up splitting with them, it'll be tough to stay friends.
What was the score of the last game?
If you're with the guy you love, you gotta dump your ex.
The best and easiest way is to just fly or drive to Vegas and tie the knot.
Sure, let's get to know each other better.
I prefer a size C or D. Anything bigger is just a waste.
Lie and then make up some more stuff.
they haven't done it before and it's double the fun!
My wife ain't into wearing those brands.
We don't know what you look like.
Opposites attract and we always end up finding a life partner. It's just how it goes!
i think this is better than my own life tbh
don't go anywhere with your new date that you went with your ex, okay?
Chat with your bestie and see if they're cool with it.
It sounds weird, but it worked for me in like 3-5 days.
i don't like it when he makes fun of you for the small stuff.
Nah, I'm not married yet.
A lot of guys dig thick girls, especially black dudes.
Anyone ever written a poem for their girl? I love expressing my feelings through poetry.
i told her i like her before and she was worried it would mess up our friendship.
If you're into him, then who cares, just stick with him.
Do they make fun of you when you're with him?
'i love those people cuz i'm a guy and i don't have to bring a date to the event.'
Don't tie the knot if you're this unsure about it.
It all depends on whether the person is vain or not.
You gotta move on and find someone who doesn't hate you to be with.
You should get to know her and eventually one of you will ask the other out.
i asked him if he was ditching me.
Maybe some rude dudes like hanging out with younger Asian girls.
It's up to you to decide.
Just tell him you wanna keep it chill.
Is he not treating you right? You should be stoked.
This situation is a tough one with tons of issues.
they've been pretty good years, not always a walk in the park.
We've been seeing each other every day for like four or five years.
Imagine I'm the guy you're into, then let's go out.
It's all good to flirt a little!
Stick with what you feel inside, that's the way to go.
Good luck to you!
Is it bad if I haven't kissed my girl after eight months?
It's up to the lady to decide.
i think they look better than a lot of other countries tbh.
It's all good for the next day.
Check if she's free for dinner and a movie.
Some dudes don't even consider their partner when they're getting busy.
Can you ask in English? I don't get what you're saying.
Sorry, but I've never felt like that before.
No bird has ever tried to fly with just one wing, dude.
i always think about this problem.
You'll never find a bae if you look all sad and stuff.
i met this girl recently and i'm wondering if she's into me.
Don't just sit around waiting for the phone to ring.
Shut up and be whatever sexual orientation you want, it's all good.
Lots of 22-year-old chicks are dating 27-year-old dudes, so the 22-year-old guys get all insecure and start looking for younger girls.
If he comes to his senses, awesome; if not, you should just move on.
He might love you, but he might also want to let his dad down.
Don't apologize to him if you didn't do anything wrong. Stay strong!
You gotta act before it's too late.
This chick ain't looking for a guy who lies to her.
i'd love to hear what an African American woman thinks about this.
Can you help me win this debate against her? Thanks!
Mostly dudes around your age, give or take, almost always.
When will people finally get it?
I'm not sure what to do.
You go to a bar and drink until you're wasted.
i acted like that around my current boo.
If you gotta ask, then that's a no-go.
Don't just sit there waiting for him to figure out that you're a catch.
Even though I'm getting divorced, I'm still stuck with this mess.
You'll be good. Have fun!
Your girl will just think you're being a jerk.
You can't fix things with her parents, but maybe you can patch things up with her friends. What's the deal?
Personally, I wouldn't marry a girl who won't give up her last name, but that's just me.
Maybe you should try hitting on younger girls since guys can be jerks.
I dated my ex for 3 years and then he/she cheated.
You'll find out eventually, but I suggest just waiting to see what happens for half a year.
The one I liked was like this.
Not all guys dump their girl.
It's so much fun going there, and there's tons of stuff to do.
Is it cool to kiss on the first date?
i have a girl friend that i'm tight with.
they're totally into each other.
When he does, just tell him you want to be with him and that breaking up was a mistake.
My friend says I'm too nice and should start saying no to him.
but, there's always an exception, right?
Not all dudes, but some do.
By doing that, you can still keep your last name.
Go up to her, say hi, and see if she's available.
That really turned me on, but I bolted.
Chubby girls can still be cute.
Not everyone here is taking classes.
Practice unwrapping Starburst and tying cherry stems with your tongue, yo.
If you keep chatting with him for another week, he's gonna start thinking he's your husband.
I'll pay if I can get your vote for best answer!
You should find a spot in public where you'll feel the most chill.
Flirt with him and see how he responds.
and it totally takes the pressure off to ask someone.
Say you'll go out with me, please!
She never forgets my screw-ups.
How do I talk to her without her thinking I'm just another guy with sketchy motives?
As a dude, I might have some thoughts on this.
Don't worry, you're only 13!
Always hit the trails with someone else when you go riding.
If you both really love each other, you'll figure it out.
Making eye contact is super important.
I can totally pick him up.
He just needs to start over and earn your trust back.
Me and my ex were together in second grade, then fourth grade, and again in eighth grade.
What's the deal with wanting to ask her out?
Hey, I really hope you take a good look at this info.
Let's play "truth or dare" together and see what happens!
Wait until you know for sure and then we can go from there.
That's dumb, you gotta take a theory class for that.
Just give up if you eat something like that.
i can't stop thinking about having sex with her.
The only way you'll find out is if you just go up to him and ask.
Jamie's gonna ask Rubi out on a date.
Y'all are still together because neither of you have the guts to break it off.
Maybe they'd find it interesting to learn about that.
He dribbles, shoots, and scores for 2 points!
Do guys really like bigger women?
he loves you too, but who knows what will happen, only time will tell.
if a guy truly respects you, he'll get where you're coming from.
We've started our own sins, y'all.
His answer is good with me.
You can still love him, but you gotta move on.
An intelligent woman is so attractive.
i think it's messed up that they can't hang out with her.
My sis always closes her eyes when she's about to kiss someone.
i met my ex while driving in a roundabout.
He's actually tying the knot this month.
Should I just forget about this and move on?
Are you gonna replay everything you did to me?
Y'all sound like you're already hitched.
First off, why didn't they just end the relationship?
He might hit you up if you give him some room.
You gotta spread the word to more peeps.
Just take it one step at a time and think about how he lost something good.
Hey Harold, when are we gonna grab dinner?
Nah, don't ask if you need to.
You gotta go to school, but you can still come home or hit up your friends and fam.
i never wanna do that again lol
Let him come to you. If you make the first move, you'll look too into him.
Some peeps choose not to do that cuz of their religion.
You should be stoked with yourself!
People do what they feel comfortable with, so no, I think it's a choice.
Think about it and it'll help you figure out if he's trustworthy or not!
I didn't mean to ask if you think women are hot and pretty.
Ask if they're gonna get all crazy.
It seems like you really love promoting yourself.
Check if the dude you're into is down to go the extra mile for you.
but it's not like you can't have feelings for each other or anything.
If they don't know anything about you, how would they even know?
Why should we care about what other people think?
What qualities would you want in your girlfriend? Like, if you could pick four.
Chicks dig it when guys are considerate.
i feel so silly, weird, and totally pumped!
Just play it cool. Being a little hard to get might actually help!
Check out how she struts.
He shouldn't care if you're at a dance together. Just have fun!
Chicks dig guys who are confident.
Hit her up for another date after class.
You should totally book an appointment with a therapist!
I think I'm still totally in love with him.
It's all good. I'm cool, if you get what I mean.
Go ahead and grab something that you can't shake.
You've only met dudes who are into a certain type.
but I ain't saying you gotta be celibate until then.
Don't make him dance if he doesn't want to.
i'm a dude. i'll let you know what i know.
My girl won't say she loves me in person.
we can't tell if she's being real or not.
Can you help me get to know her better?
My hair is long and black, and both me and my husband love it.
People are just making decisions super fast right now.
maybe they're trying to be something they're not?
Nah, you won't, buddy. I was married to someone who was totally thoughtless.
You gotta keep your distance from your male friend.
i'm looking for a girl who wants to hang out with me.
'For me, it's been the best thing ever.'
I met this guy once, and it was like a romantic movie. We first crossed paths in the middle of a crazy rainstorm.
You'll get paid more if you're down to put in more hours.
i wonder if things will ever be the same after that.
It might be that you just gotta pick one and know why you picked it.
Chill for 4 more years.
i'm stoked that i've got brown hair.
If you want to get a gift for your husband, I'd recommend sports stuff or car tools.
That's not who you can be, dude.
The problem is that he totally messed up by cheating on me.
Imagine yourself hanging out with him at night.
That hurt so bad, and then I started bleeding.
It could mean a bunch of stuff.
Ten years apart is just so appealing.
You gotta do more than just make eye contact, you know?
Do you want all your friends to be with you for life?
i can't stand him because of how he acted.
I know what I want in a relationship, though.
It happened in the middle of the river, with people watching. It was so funny!
If you're hot too, just flash him your boobs.
So, it's totally normal for that guy.
i get so happy when i see a malaysia air ad on TV!
Go out and do all the things you couldn't do when you were in a relationship. Go wild!
It's totally possible to get more pleasure from giving than receiving.
Is it normal to still be into him after six months?
If you start feeling it, just go back to the foreplay.
Guys will think you're hot no matter what, most of the time.
it's a challenge, but I'm up for it!
just ask a lady walking around, they're all over the place in Thailand.
It's super important to last for like 30-45 minutes.
I'm worried because I'm really into him.
It's buy one, get one free, that's why.
I didn't know Pakistan was so conservative, man.
Let's wrestle and become BFFs.
I hardly ever see him at school but I've seen him at my bro's basketball games.
You didn't give us much info, where do y'all live?
You gotta admit why you're into her.
It's like they're not feeling you.
Everyone's gotta split up at some point.
I worked there for a bit and met this dude who I'm totally in love with.
I'll probably go check it out.
What's the hold up? Just go ahead and do what you want.
Yo, there are actually more guys out there who dig curvy women, even though you might not think so.
I didn't think he'd remember, I was just being casual when I said it.
Chicks don't dig dudes who are all about themselves.
You gotta check it out.
either a CD or a DVD will work.
You guys work really hard to get it right!
If she's interested, she'll give me a call later.
'i really care about you and can't stop thinking about you when we're not together.'
Should I give him another shot at some point?
If it feels like your love is fading, don't brush it off.
Daniel has never checked out a manga book.
If they really work, give these a shot.
I've been in the same situation too.
or does she just wanna hang out with other folks?
Pick the one you like best.
Get ready to say goodbye to her.
I sometimes spill the beans about my issues too soon in a relationship, and maybe I overshared with that guy.
I bet it's common, but I'd just go for it.
Just get rid of him, it's for the best.
"Sometimes, but you gotta keep an eye on your partner."
You grab the popcorn if he gets there first.
Why does it even matter if it's a rebound for both of you?
My girl is the most passionate person I know, and I love her even more for it.
one day, you'll find a guy who really deserves you.
Stay strong and don't give up, okay?
How about blue and green instead?
Some dudes do, some don't.
i want a girl who's nice and smart.
It's not as bad as it could've been, at least it's not bella. Thank goodness!
It's more like 65% or 70% instead of 90%.
what good did it even do?
i don't know what she wants.
My BFF totally hates my partner and wants us to break up, but that's not gonna happen.
We were just hanging out for a bit.
You still dropped a grand, at least.
All my friends wanna do is make out like crazy.
Happy bday to you!
Chicks think with their brain activity.
In my opinion, you should give her a compliment, ask for her name, and just be cool and smooth.
How long do you have to wait before you can say it's taking too long and she's not really interested?
Chicks don't think it's cool. They think guys who smoke are lame because they're killing themselves.
I'm only myself around guys I'm not into. You know how it goes.
the timing with the old dude wasn't right, you'll see.
Let's take both of them out on a date.
i'm my sister's maid-of-honor and i want everything to be perfect!
I can never sleep because my boyfriend snores so loud!
If they don't get along, they shouldn't hang out together. Who cares what they think?
Don't tell her you wanna be with her forever and you might have a better shot at things staying the way they are.
Just tell her to only hit you up for important stuff.
I gotta stop right now, I really gotta go pee.
I could totally start forgetting about you after three days.
Or are you just trying to say that?
Before anyone gets hurt, I'm on board with the other person.
People don't like being messed with like a yo-yo.
i'd love it if that happened to me.
You can totally win her over with love and affection.
Guys have a dick and girls have a clit.
By now, you should totally be in love with your wife for all the stuff you guys have been through.
i don't need a high maintenance chick, i want a partner
I hate it, but I love the plain old variety.
If she likes him, then there's a reason.
There's no one you can trust more than a good friend, ya know?
That's weird but maybe. I don't know. I'll talk to my friend later by his locker.
If you're just average, boob size doesn't really make a difference.
'i'm a dude so i have feelings too.'
Hit up their question and answer team. They'll help you out with the process. Have a great day!
i like smart, nice, and interesting ladies.
Nice, that girl got the first question for me.
if they send a sexy pic, they wanna hook up.
Where have you been meeting these Filipina ladies?
Maybe you should just ask him to grab lunch or see a movie or something.
i haven't because i like guys who look regular.
i had someone get really mean with me because i kept dating.
i love him, but i'm also ready to move on tbh.
Yeah, just ask for permission. See how quickly she gets aggressive with you.
Guys think they're all that and that only some girls are up to their standards.
i wanna get some action here and there.
i've heard this a bunch of times.
You seem like the alpha in the relationship.
Just wait for someone who will appreciate you for who you are.
don't go there, it looks sketchy.
it's all about how it looks.
It's time to forget about him, if you're meant to be, he'll come back to you.
The guy I like is mad at me.
'You into Asian food?'
My cousin hooked up with this weird older guy she met online who said he was a horny teenager.
If you need to ask, just know that I haven't fallen in love.
Don't even listen to what anyone says, just watch how they act.
Don't let any guy tell you how to act, just be yourself.
i still love him, what do i do?
Just chat with your partner about it.
If you flutter your eyelashes at him, the challenge disappears.
Another option is you could just tell her and have a fairy tale romance, ya know?
You're killing the romance by asking that dumb question. Maybe we should do something fun together instead?
also, wanna kiss and see how good you are at it?
jules sac is hilarious but he can be a jerk too.
Have you seen my partner around?
imo, when a guy is super self-absorbed, it just makes him way less attractive.
I know this because I have a personality similar to your wife, lol.
I don't think you're ready if you have to ask others.
Rip your shirt off and scream like Tarzan!
If you don't love your husband anymore, then just move on and make space for another guy.
You're really good at what you do.
i'm into this guy in 6th grade too!
they feel weird around guys with less education.
Maybe we can go on a date and see if we catch feelings for each other.
If she snitches to the administration, I'm getting kicked out because this is Pakistan, not America.
My friend is dating someone they met online.
i love snuggling with a big girl.
i think the bomb is way easier!
i met ______'s (insert name) dad from his side of the fam.
anything that can't be easily moved.
Let's be friends first and see where it goes from there.
i got played for three years in that relationship.
Attack him just because he likes someone else? SMH.
Don't tell them beforehand, let them find out when you're in bed together.
It's not a big deal here in the US.
Be confident and always believe in yourself, but don't get cocky. Make sure to keep good eye contact and really listen to what she's saying.
Just let it do its thing.
i know cuz i dated someone like that.
I wish I had listened to my friends' comments.
Ditch him if he acts up.
Do whatever makes you feel good!
we tried to move on, but it didn't work out.
If you're not feeling brave enough to ask, someone else might do it for you.
My twin won't even talk to me, let alone listen.
She'll answer the question, cuz most girls are polite.
You married him for a reason, right?
Hit him up and see if he wants to catch a movie with you.
Some women can't find guys their age that are hot.
It doesn't matter, we're just friends anyway.
If that ever happens, sign up for some self-defense classes.
It seemed like that to me, but what do I know? lol
How wasted is this chick gonna get?
You should get to know both of them before deciding to date either one.
He's totally into you, you know?
You can join a community with live and webcam chat. Come hang out and chat with us!
Man, those were some good times.
If you're a player, then he is too.
White girls be stealing all the guys!
i'd be losing it if she called me 5 times a day.
You might be the only one he can hook up with.
Let the troublemaker know he's gotta leave.
Dang, how old are you?
they think they can run other people's lives but they can't lol
You'd totally let him go if you're into him.
someone I can just be myself around.
It's easy from here on out!
Tell them 'I love you.' It'll spill the beans if they hold out on saying it back.
I just got out of a three-year relationship with the father of my baby.
Good luck finding your perfect match!
Even though it's been a while, I still love him.
He already knows you care about him. Has he mentioned it at all?
everyone has their own preferences on who they think is hot.
My wife is pretty chill and forgiving.
What's gonna go down if you ask him to be friends with benefits?
i like him and he's like, "I'd totally date you if you were single."
Chicks can be even worse than dudes.
She might be trying to use you, just a heads up.
Please don't do anything that could hurt you.
You'd be shocked to see who's into him.
Wait until you're 25 to do it. Your appeal won't go down by then.
That's the way to go if you're dead set on it.
Do dudes even know what they want in a relationship?
If you still need your ex for emotional support, you're gonna have some issues.
If you're into it and kinda like it, just roll with it.
Remember, the vow is until death do us part! LOL
It's totally fine for her to ask for your number.
If the answer is yes, then why do I hear so many girls saying flowers won't last? Just curious lol
Don't be shallow and just focus on her appearance.
Just ask her that question, it shouldn't be a big deal if you're in a serious relationship.
I'd choose Maui or the Bahamas for sure.
The prob is if you're gonna ask her out at work or not.
He was so smooth when he asked me out, it was kind of charming.
You're totally setting up a double standard.
I can't give a wife's perspective, but I hope my opinion is still helpful.
It's totally okay to feel disappointed and pissed off.
He got to his stop, so he hopped off the train.
Hit me up and let's start from the beginning, then fast forward 20 years.
Don't be scared to say, 'no.'
I don't care what she says, just leave it be, she's already hurting enough.
If it doesn't work out, you could lose your job, just saying.
You could give dancing at a club a shot.
i've passed up on some awesome opportunities because i'm always thinking about others.
How do I get him to stop bugging me?
When you're 18-20, you might say stuff you don't really mean.
i wonder why he decided to shave his legs.
You gotta be nice, make eye contact, and throw in a smile.
What's everyone's thoughts on this?
Hey guys, quick question - what size woman do you prefer?
She doesn't want you to just like her because she's pretty.
Good luck, that's all I can say!
The only time I told a girl I loved her and actually meant it was that one time.
If she says yes, then go grab them.
If you wanna be friends with her, chances are you want something more.
You'll hurt your fam if you keep hiding stuff.
Be real and show some confidence. That's what women, or at least most women, dig. But most importantly, just be yourself.
Don't stress about what other people say.
Any guy who says he would is probably not being totally honest with himself.
Forget about him and just go out with his brother instead.
Death is like a whole box of candy corn. It'll rot your teeth.
i wouldn't want a pair that huge.
Others think it's because society says so, but I think we should go against the norm and love curvier women.
that just makes it easier to have sex with her.
Give him a ring if you're really feeling it for him.
It's just because you don't have any say in the decision.
It's your life, so make your own choices.
As you get older, keep dating younger guys to make yourself feel younger and better.
btw, i'm not the type of girl who likes a romantic dinner at home.
I'm only doing this to get points.
You're gonna have to take that risk.
Work on your relationship, but don't let him keep you cooped up at home.
Whatever you do, don't tell him too early.
It's not a good idea to date people you work with.
If going to the movies is your thing as a couple, definitely do that.
It happens after 'threeplay' and before 'fiveplay.'
Get a sex toy that you both would have fun with.
"Guys are just naturally egotistical, it's just something we have to deal with."
'i'm with udaman on this one.'
I really like him, but I wanna convince him, not get turned down.
I'm not even thinking about him, but he keeps popping up in my dreams.
He won't move on until he finds someone else.
You gotta go out and meet some new people.
Don't do anything you'll regret later, okay?
The safest way to do internet dating is to chat through email and on the phone.
'Yep, I did it and it was so much fun!'
There's loads of cheap ideas. Find what you're into and go from there.
You might be done looking for the guys who think you're amazing.
you'll find your perfect match, Mrs. Right.
You know you're meant to be together if you can fart in front of each other.
i hope i see some of it real soon!
Just go up to her and start talking.
I have no idea how old you are, which would be helpful.
Yeah, that's definitely not a healthy habit.
We don't have space for crazy monsters like this in our society.
"Did you mean, 'seems more spicy?'"
Is this question misleading? Just wondering.
It's like saying, "What's gonna stop me now that I've already done it?"
Picking the right date can save you a ton of cash.
That's all I gotta say about that.
Why do guys find it so tough to say "I love you"?
If she really loves you, your girl should be cool with that.
he then asked if I could roll with you.
A lot of guys just want to get laid.
usually that happens cuz of a spasm in the back.
They should try using our last names. Maybe give it a shot?
You're gonna lose your friend because of some guy.
You'll know if he's into you!
i love that they're into the challenge.
Make her a mixtape or burn her a CD.
i wanna be happy.
don't try to have sex.
Sometimes when I'm dating someone, I get embarrassed.
When you're ready, it's totally worth the wait!
You're too precious for those folks.
So, does this mean he's into me?
i think the guy should make the first move in a relationship.
If I could, I'd totally keep my last name.
You gotta let go of the bad stuff and keep it moving.
Hit him up and see how he's doing every now and then.
Go out and try new things to meet new people!
'i still have feelings for my ex and i'm so mad at my cousin because now my ex likes her.'
'it was actually a pretty good idea.'
Let's celebrate Valentine's Day with joy, presents, and a good time!
Just for looks, nothing else.
they never stood a chance, man.
but I think they both like me.
they're into petite girls.
Don't forget to pick and vote for the best answer!
Me and my husband have been together for four years. We just tied the knot in December 2005.
Navy Pier and the museums are awesome to check out. There are also tons of cool restaurants and hotels.
One of them is always cheating on the other.
No stress, I don't have a ton of choices either.
My mom books trips at pat@alanatvl.com, hit her up if you need to plan a vacay!
It's been over six months and I just can't seem to get over it.
She needs to move to Massachusetts.
It doesn't matter, but I'm good with a few.
Some ladies like gifts that last forever, like non-perishable ones.
She's strong, loving, but not as happy as she thought.
You're young if you're into sixth graders. Just saying.
Size, shape, looks, and all that jazz shouldn't matter one bit.
What's their take on gay relationships?
I'm down, give him a smooch and he'll get back to you.
He gave me his cell so I could add my number.
If you wanna have a good time, maybe hit up some clubs, restaurants, or gyms.
So, I'd say they do pull it off, but not all the time. Hope that helps!
If you're in Florida, hit me up!
Hit her up and ask her out on a date!
Sorry, I don't know. Good luck to both of you!
hey, i wanna come check out your country!
Look for another hot girl to make her jealous.
Don't ask that question if you don't want to get upset, okay?
She knows how much I care about him, so I'm clueless about what to do.
And does he always stare like that?
You should try some foreplay, it helps to slow things down a bit.
Fair skinned ladies tend to look even paler when they have black hair.
i wasn't gonna let her go in first.
Never ever call her fat.
Wanna hear a lame joke?
You know it would be a guilt trip if you didn't play.
He's having a blast while you're not around lol.
Yeah, I totally think anyone would.
Some couples will never be super chill with each other.
"Guys don't seem to be any better, tbh."
i never went on another date with that guy.
You're probably the hottest girl they've ever seen.
you've found your soulmate and you gotta be with them.
You won't have to prove anything if the guy is worth it.
You're too young to be talking about kissing already.
Order one online and then a magical stork will deliver it to you. Just like that!
It's getting harder as time goes on.
Just keep doing your thing and find someone else!
How old are they? Like, what's their age?
All you gotta do now is just smile.
The deal is you gotta stop talking to him and stop thinking about him.
Those girls who whine about flowers not lasting long are just ungrateful.
i'm laughing cuz that's why i'm single lol
The ladies who are cute or have a great personality.
'i'm not into girls.'
You gotta just cut off your cousin and your boyfriend completely.
I can't remember ever giving a girl a Christmas present unless I really liked her.
Who can tell if country gals feel sexier?
i met mine at a carnival lol
My hubby digs my personality.
she ain't no liar.
If they don't do it, it's time to keep going.
Decide what kind of flowers and arrangements you want. Hit me up with your choice!
If he's cool with it, who else has a relevant opinion?
You're probably way too good for him.
She lets me tinker with my trucks and chill with cartoons.
Lime green is totally a summer wedding color.
Is there anything I can do to fix it?
The right relationship just happened naturally.
Looks don't matter unless you're trying to prove a point.
Just be real with me, I can take it.
You could start the day by grabbing breakfast and then going for a nice walk.
I messed up and accidentally did this before, and my friend got mad that I deleted him.
Don't have sex, okay?
Don't forget to be polite when you tell her.
When you're both ready, go ahead and kiss.
Hit her up with questions (but don't just chat).
I think you're a good guy. She probably really likes you a lot.
When she calls, just text back.
Nah, that's totally not cool. You're just messing up your health because girls really can't stand it.
You gotta find someone you're into and ask them to be your valentine.
You should totally tell her that you miss and love her.
If nothing happens, ask him again.
Some people just don't have it, but others do.
He will definitely not say no to your request.
That's a cool pic of George Clooney!
My partner wants me to switch up my look.
those responses are so full of themselves, I'm way hotter.
My teeth are a mess, my breath stinks, and I have terrible body odor.
Ain't no words gonna make this situation better.
The world would be a happier place if guys knew what girls want.
You wanna give head to another dude?
i'd rather you not tie the knot.
yeah, I'm a guy so I don't really have to pay.
If he wants to rock my pants, he just needs to ask.
