An entangled confession doth merit naught but an entangled absolution.
I doth love the fair daughter of rich Capulet.
We art bound to each other in every possible way, except we doth need thee to marry us.
I shall recount anon the tale of our meeting, the manner of our love's inception, and the exchange of our vows. But for now, I do beseech thee: grant us the boon of thy consent to wed this very day.
O, blessed Saint Francis, this change is most dire!
Hast thou so quickly forsaken fair Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dearly?
Hence, doth young men love with their eyes, and not with their hearts.
The groans thou didst once utter still doth ring in mine ancient ears.
Thou still dost bear a mark upon thy cheek from a tear of yore that hath not yet been cleansed.
If thou wert ever true to thyself, and this sorrow was thine own, thou and thy sorrow were all for Rosaline.
And hast thou now changed?
Then repeateth this after me: thou canst not expecteth women to be faithful when men art so unreliable.
Thou hast oft chastised me for mine affection towards Rosaline.
I did chide thee for thy obsession with her, not for thy love of her, my pupil.
Thou didst instruct me to inter my affection.
I did not bid thee to discard one love and supplant her with another.
I pray thee, do not chide me, I beseech thee.
The other maiden hath no love for me.
Oh, she knew full well that thou wert feigning love without understanding the true meaning of love.
But hark, thou fickle youth, come hither with me.
Let us depart from this place.
I am in haste.
Hie thee wisely and with measured pace.
Those who doth haste, doth stumble and taketh a fall.
Wherefore doth Romeo tarry?
Came he not home yesternight?
Unto his father's abode not.
I did inquire of a humble servant.
That fair-skinned, hard-hearted hussy, Rosaline, shall torment him until he doth go mad.
Tybalt, nephew of old Capulet, hath dispatched a missive unto the abode of Romeo's sire.
I wager it be a challenge.
Romeo shall respond to the challenge.
Any man who doth possess the knowledge of writing may respond to a missive.
Nay, Romeo shall make reply to the author of the letter, declaring whether he doth accept the challenge.
Alas, wretched Romeo!
Doth he possess the valor to confront Tybalt at this juncture?
Pray, what tale hath Tybalt?
Doth he know what?
He doth appear lean, akin to a withered herring lacking its spawn, and he hath not his fair maiden.
Oh flesh, flesh, thou hast turned pale and weak like a fish.
Now he is prepared for.
Hail and well met to thee, both of you.
What dost thou mean by accusing me of feigning?
Thou hast eluded us, sir, eluded us.
Canst thou not comprehend the words that I do speak?
The right is mine own.
Mine employer is as good as thine.
But he doth not surpass mine own.
Hark!
Thou dost deceive.
Gregory, dost thou remember how to slash?
What ho?
Pray, Benvolio, come hither and part this fray.
I am losing this contest of wit.
Continue on, continue on, or I shall declare myself the victor.
Thou hast more wild goose in one of thy jests than I have in five of mine.
Was I e'en near thee in the pursuit of the goose?
Thou wert never with me for aught if thou wert not there for the goose.
I shall bite thee on the ear for that jest.
Nay, fair fowl, do not peck at me.
Thy jest is a most bitter apple.
Thy humor doth resemble a piquant sauce.
Is't not the proper fare for a fair fowl?
Oh, that jest is but a leather prating, stretching itself from a mere inch to a yard's girth.
I doth stretch my jest for yon word "fat." If thou doth append that word to the word "goose," it doth reveal thou art a fat goose.
Wherefore, is not all this jesting finer than lamenting o'er love?
Thou art now sociable.
Thou art now Romeo.
Oh, thou art mistaken.
I would have made it brief.
I had come to the deepest part of my tale, and I did intend to speak no more on the matter.
Hark! Behold, a goodly thing.
There be two, a man and a woman.
Hark! Peter!
I am at thy service.
Pray, Peter, deliver unto me my fan.
Hail, good morrow, sirs.
Hail, fair lady, and good morrow to thee.
Doth the sun now stand at its midday height?
Verily, it is not ere than that, I doth tell thee.
Hence, depart from this place!
What manner of man art thou?
I am a man, my lady, whom God hath fashioned for his own destruction.
I do swear, thou speakest the truth.
"Forsooth, he doth declare to bring ruin upon himself," quoth he.
Hark, good sirs, can any of you direct me to the whereabouts of young Romeo?
I can thee tell, but young Romeo shall be elder when thou dost find him than he was when thou didst commence thy search for him.
I am the youngest man bearing that name, for there is none younger, nor more wretched.
Thou dost speak with great eloquence.
Is the well worst?
Methinks 'tis very well spoken, I doth believe 'tis very wise.
She shall be a procurer!
I have discovered it.
What hast thou discovered?
Romeo, art thou going to thy father's for luncheon?
Hark! Let us hie thither.
I shall follow in your wake.
He doth speak more in one minute than he doth in a whole month.
Should he speak aught against me, I shall humble him, even if he be stronger than he is, and twenty ruffians like him.
If I cannot accomplish it on mine own, I shall seeketh one who can.
Thou foul knave!
I am not one of his strumpets.
I am not one of his base companions who doth bear a blade.
I didst not witness anyone using thee for sport.
If mine eyes had beheld such a sight, I would have swiftly drawn forth my weapon.
Marry, trust me, I shall draw my sword as swift as any other man if I spy a quarrel commencing and the law doth favor my cause.
Now, by my troth, I do swear, I am so angered that I do shake all over.
Thou art a knave, foul and putrid!
Nurse, convey my greetings to thy mistress.
I do swear to thee, thou hast a good heart, and trust me, I shall convey that message unto her.
My lord, my lord, she shall be a joyful lady.
What tidings wilt thou impart to her, nurse?
Thou art not giving me thine attention.
At Friar Lawrence's cell, she may make confession and be joined in holy matrimony.
Pray, tarry, good nurse.
In but an hour, one of my men shall approach thee behind yon abbey wall and deliver unto thee a rope ladder.
Farewell.
Be thou honest and helpful, and I shall repay thee for thy efforts.
Farewell.
Singeth my praises to thy mistress.
May the heavens above bless thee, by God's grace.
Hark, I pray thee, good sir, lend me thine ear.
Pray, what hast thou to say, my dear nurse?
Can thy man keepeth a secret?
Hast thou ne'er heard the adage, "two may conspire to put one away"?
I doth assure thee, my man is as true as steel.
Well, sir, my mistress doth possess the sweetest countenance.
My lord, my lord, when she was but a babe, oh, there is a nobleman in the city, a gentleman named Paris, who would gladly lay claim to her.
I doth anger her at times by declaring that Paris is fairer than thou art.
But when I doth say so, I do swear she turns as pale as a sheet.
"Doth not, aye, nurse, what sayest thou of that?"
Both doth commence with the letter "r." Ah, thou jester, that is the name of the hound.
Pray, convey my regards to thy lady.
Yea, a thousandfold.
Hark! Peter!
I am prepared.
I did dispatch the nurse at the hour of nine.
Mayhap she cannot find him.
That cannot be.
Oh, she doth move at a snail's pace!
The messengers of love should be thoughts, which doth fly ten times faster than sunbeams.
Three hours hath passed since the hour of nine, yet she hath not returned.
If she were youthful and full of passion, she would move as swiftly as a ball.
My words would lead her to my sweet love, and his words would lead her back to me.
But many elders doth comport themselves as if they be already departed, languid, tardy, corpulent, and lacking in hue, akin to lead.
Oh, sweet nurse, what tidings doth thou bring?
Hast thou spoken to him?
Dispatch thy man hence.
Peter, tarry for me at the gate.
Now, fair and gentle nurse, oh my word, why dost thou appear so melancholy?
Pray, even if the tidings be woeful, doth tell me with a countenance of mirth.
If the tidings be fair, thou art spoiling the sweet tidings by playing a jest with a sour countenance such as that.
I am wearied.
Pray, leave me be for a moment.
Oh, my, my bones doth ache so sorely.
I doth wish thou hadst my bones, and I had thy news.
Canst thou not tarry for a moment?
Dost thou not perceive that I am out of breath?
How canst thou be out of breath when thou hast enough breath to tell me that thou art out of breath?
Thy excuse to delay the tidings is longer than the tidings themselves.
Doth the tidings be of good or ill?
Hark, provide an answer to yon query.
Pray, inform me if it be good or ill, and I shall tarry for the particulars.
Pray, inform me so that I may find contentment.
Is it fair or foul?
Hark! Thou hast made a foolish choice.
Thou knowest not how to choose a man.
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?
Nay, not he, though his visage be fairer than any man's, and his limbs more comely, yet his hands, feet, and body are naught to boast of, and yet they surpass all others.
He is not the most courteous man in the world, but, believe me, he is gentle as a lamb.
Hark, do as thou wilt.
Be thou good.
Hast thou had thy midday meal?
Nay, I have not partaken of mine midday repast.
All that thou hast told me, I already did possess in mine knowledge.
What sayeth he of our union?
What sayeth thou?
Mine head doth poundeth.
Mine back doth ache as well.
Hark! I doth beseech thee, I am sorry that thou art in such anguish.
Hark, hark, hark, gentle nurse, prithee, what did my love Romeo speak?
Thy love doth speak, as doth an honorable gentleman, who is courteous, kind, handsome, and, I doth believe, virtuous. Wherefore is thy mother?
Wherefore doth my mother reside?
Wherefore, she doth reside within.
Whither else would she be?
Thy response is most peculiar!
Thy love doth inquire, as a noble gentleman, "Wherefore doth thy mother reside?"
Art thou so impatient?
Hark! Thou art being absurd!
Doth this be the remedy for mine aching bones?
Henceforth, attend to thine own missives.
Thou art making such a fuss.
Pray, what did Romeo say?
Hast thou the leave to venture forth and make thy confession this day?
I doth.
Hie thee hence and make haste to Friar Lawrence's cell.
Yonder stands a husband, eagerly awaiting to take thee as his wife.
Now do I behold the crimson tide rushing to thy fair visage.
Thou dost turn as red as a rose at the sound of any tidings.
Hie thee to the church.
Thy love shall employ it to ascend unto thy casement whilst it is dark.
Hie thee hence.
I shall hie me to luncheon.
Thou shalt go to Friar Lawrence's cell.
I doth only seeketh to maintain the peace.
Hence, either sheathe thy sword or wield it in aid of mine endeavor to cease this quarrel.
What ho?
I doth despise the word peace as much as I doth despise hell, all Montagues, and thee.
Let us engage in combat, thou craven!
Hark! Employ thy clubs and spears!
Smite them!
Hence, let us smite them!
Down with the Capulets! 
Down with the Montagues! 
What ho! What meaneth this clamor?
I doth desire my trusty blade.
Old Montague doth present, and he doth brandish his sword to incite my anger.
Capulet, thou knave!
Thou art not taking one step toward an enemy.
Hark! Bestow upon me thy well wishes.
I doth thank thee, dear nurse.
Verily, verily.
But, whate'er misfortunes doth occur, they canst not ruin the joy i feeleth with one look at her.
Hence, let us love one another in temperance.
Verily, that be the key to love enduring.
Too swift is as ill as too tardy.
Hark! The lady doth approacheth.
Oh, a footstep as light as hers shall ne'er endure the rocky path of life.
Thus doth pleasure prove frail and insubstantial.
Romeo shall thank thee, my fair maiden, for the both of us.
I shall bestow upon him equal gratitude, thus restoring balance between us.
Ah, Juliet, if thou art as joyful as I, and thou art more skilled with words, prithee, speak of the happiness thou dost envision for our union.
I canst imagine more than I canst speak, I have more on my mind than words.
Hark, hark! Come hither with me, and swiftly shall we accomplish the task.
I do beseech thee, kind Mercutio, let us bid the day adieu.
Thou art akin to those fellows who doth enter a tavern, doth slam their sword upon the table, and then doth declare, "I pray I never have to employ thee." Ere he doth call for his second beverage, he doth draw his sword upon the barkeep without cause.
Doth I truly resemble one of those gentlemen?
Hark thee, thou canst be as angry as any man in Italy when thou art in the mood.
And what sayeth thee to that?
If there were two men such as thee, anon there would be none, for the twain of you would slay each other.
Thou wouldst engage in combat with a man if he possessed one more whisker or one less whisker in his beard than thou hast in thine own beard.
Thou shalt engage in combat with a man who doth cracketh nuts, merely for thine eyes are the color of hazelnuts.
Thou alone wouldst seeketh a quarrel such as that.
Thy head is as full of fights as an egg is full of yolk, but thy head hath been beaten like scrambled eggs from so much fighting.
Thou didst provoke a quarrel with a man who did cough in the street, for he did rouse a sleeping dog that lay basking in the sun.
Didst thou not dispute with thy tailor for wearing one of his new suits ere the proper season?
And doth he seek another to bind the new shoes he hath made with old laces?
And yet thou art the one who doth desire to instruct me in the art of self-control!
If I were in the habit of fighting as thou art, my life insurance rates would be sky high.
Doth thou possess life insurance?
That is but a foolish notion.
Hark! Behold, the Capulets approacheth.
Hark, hark, I doth not care.
Put it together with some other thing.
Make it a word and a bloweth.
Thou shalt find me ready enough to do that, sir, if thou give me a reason.
Canst thou not find a reason without mine own giving thee one?
Mercutio, thou dost consort with Romeo.
"Pray, dost thou think we art musicians in a band, that we should hang out?"
If we appear as minstrels to thee, thou shalt hear naught but discord.
We doth converse in a public setting.
Hie thee to a private chamber, or engage in rational discourse, or else depart from my presence.
Out yonder doth all eyes lay upon us.
Men's eyes were fashioned to behold, therefore, let them gaze.
I shall not budge to please any man.
Hark, may peace be with thee.
Hark! My man approacheth, the man I seeketh.
He is not thy man.
Tybalt, I have a cause to hold thee dear, which doth excuse the anger I ought to feel and pardon that offense.
I am no knave.
Farewell, then.
I can discern thou knowest not mine identity.
Boy, thy words cannot excuse the harm thou hast wrought upon me.
Hark! Turneth now and draw thy sword.
And so, good Capulet, which is a name I love as my own, thou shouldst be content with my words.
This tranquil yielding is dishonourable and base.
What dost thou desire from me?
Wilt thou draw thy sword from its scabbard?
Haste thee, or I shall smite thee upon thine ears with my sword ere thou hast drawn thine own.
I shall engage in combat with thee.
Hark, noble Mercutio, sheathe thy sword.
Let us away, Tybalt.
I have been wounded.
May a plague curse thy families, both of them.
I am done.
Hath he escaped unscathed?
What, art thou injured?
Verily, 'tis sufficient.
Wherefore doth my page tarry?
Hark! Be of stout heart, good sir.
Methinks the wound cannot be so dire.
Nay, it doth not reach as deep as a well, nor as wide as a church door, yet it sufficeth.
Inquire of me on the morrow, and thou shalt discover me in a tomb.
I am undone in this world, I doth believe.
May a plague befall upon thy houses.
I cannot believe that dog, that rat, that mouse, that cat could scratch me to death! 
That braggart, punk villain who fights as if he hath learned swordsmanship from a manual!
Wherefore didst thou come betwixt us, thou knave?
He hath smote me from beneath thine arm.
Methought it was the right thing to do.
Take me within yon dwelling, Benvolio, or I shall swoon.
May a plague smite thy kin and thy kindred!
They hath transformed me into sustenance for the earth's lowly creatures.
I am undone.
May thy families be cursed!
Oh Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio hath been slain!
Hark! The furious Tybalt doth approach once more.
He doth live and hath triumphed, whilst Mercutio hath met his demise?
Either thou, or I, or both of us must accompany him.
Thou wretched boy, thou didst consort with him here, and thou shalt ascend to heaven with him.
This battle shall determine whose fate is to perish.
Romeo, depart from this place.
The citizens doth surround, and Tybalt hath met his end.
Stand thee not there in shock.
The prince shall bestow upon thee the penalty of death should thou be apprehended.
Depart from this place!
Wherefore art thou waiting?
Whither hath the man who hath slain Mercutio gone?
Tybalt, that villainous knave, which path hath he taken?
Tybalt doth lie yonder.
Speak, my dear nephew.
Wert thou present when it did commence?
Wherefore art the wicked men who did commence this fray?
Oh, noble prince, I can recount to thee all the woeful happenings of this deadly fray.
He hath slain thy kinsman, valiant Mercutio, and then young Romeo hath slain him.
Tybalt was mine own nephew!
He was the son of my brother!
Oh, kin, kin!
Who hath begun this fray, Benvolio?
"Cease, my companions," Romeo did exclaim.
"Break it up," quoth he, then did he leap betwixt them and did compel them to lower their swords.
Ere I could part the fray, Tybalt hath been slain.
Romeo did flee when Tybalt did perish.
Benvolio doth belong to the noble house of Montague.
He doth not speaketh the truth.
Twenty Montagues did engage in this dreadful fray, yet together they could only slay one man.
Thou, O prince, art the man who can bestow justice upon me.
Romeo hath slain Tybalt.
Romeo must needs perish.
Romeo hath slain Tybalt.
Who shall now bear the burden for the loss of Mercutio's life?
His misdeed hath wrought justice by claiming the life of Tybalt.
I am entangled in thy feud.
I shall punish thee so harshly that thou shalt rue causing me this loss.
I shall not hearken to thy pleas nor excuses.
Thou canst not escape trouble by praying or weeping, so trouble not thyself.
Remove this corpse, and obey my command.
Pardoning killers doth breed more murders, for 'tis an act of mercy that doth encourage further bloodshed.
Else love be blind, and its prime hour be the night.
I doth long for the night to fall, like a widow clad in mourning attire, so that I may learn to yield to my husband and surrender my maidenhood.
Pray, let the crimson tide in my cheeks be stilled.
Hark, night approacheth.
Hark, Romeo, come hither.
Thou art whiter than the snow upon the black wings of a raven.
His visage shall adorn the heavens so fair, that the world shall swoon for the night and forsake the gaudy sun.
Doth thou possess the rope ladder that Romeo bid thee to procure?
Aye, aye, this be the rope ladder.
Oh my, pray tell, what tidings doth thou bring?
Wherefore dost thou appear so vexed?
"He hath departed this mortal coil."
We art undone, fair lady, we art undone!
What a day of woe!
Can the Almighty be so envious and full of hate?
Romeo doth bear hate, though God doth not.
What manner of devil art thou to torment me thus?
This is as dire as the torments of Hades.
Hath Romeo slain himself?
Simply say "aye" and I shall become more venomous than the serpent with the malevolent gaze.
If he hath been slain, say "aye." If not, say "nay." These brief words shall determine whether I am filled with joy or sorrow.
I shall send mine eyes to prison, and they shall ne'er be free to gaze upon aught henceforth.
I shall render my base body unto the earth.
Oh, Tybalt, Tybalt, he was the dearest friend I e'er had.
I doth wisheth I had not lived long enow to witness his demise.
Hath Romeo been slain, and hath Tybalt met his end as well?
Tybalt was mine own dearest cousin.
Tybalt hath met his end, and Romeo hath been exiled.
Oh lord, hath Romeo's hand spilled Tybalt's blood?
Verily, it hath, it hath.
Cursed be the day this hath occurred, yet it hath.
Oh, he doth resemble a serpent cloaked in the guise of a fair blossom.
Hath a dragon e'er concealed in so fair a cavern?
He doth possess the plumage of the dove, yet hath the heart of a raven.
Oh nature, what wert thou doing in hell?
Hath there ever been such a wicked tome with such a fair binding?
Hark! Wherefore hath my servant gone? Fetch me some brandy. These griefs, these pains, these sorrows doth age me.
Romeo, thou art shamed!
I do wish that sores doth cover thy tongue for such a wish!
He was not born to bear shame.
He doth merit naught but honor, full honor.
Verily, I was a beast to be angry at him.
Art thou going to speak well of the man who hath slain thy kinsman?
But wherefore, thou villain, hast thou slain my kinsman?
Perchance, my cousin, the villain, would have slain my husband.
Verily, this doth bring comfort to mine ears.
Wherefore, should I weep?
I would fain forget it, but it doth burden my memory as sins doth haunt guilty minds.
Tybalt hath met his end, and Romeo hath been exiled.
Verily, the exile is more grievous than the slaying of ten thousand Tybalts.
The death of Tybalt would be grievous, if that were the extent of our misfortune.
It would have been better had she, after uttering "Tybalt's dead," informed me that my mother or my father, or both, were departed.
But to declare that Tybalt hath met his end, and then to proclaim, "Romeo hath been exiled," is akin to declaring that my father, my mother, Tybalt, Romeo, and Juliet have all perished, they are all deceased.
Romeo hath been banished. That tidings bringeth infinite death.
No words canst express the anguish.
Wherefore art my father and my mother, nurse?
They doth weep and wail o'er the lifeless form of Tybalt.
Art thou going to join them?
I shall convey thee thither.
Art they washing out his wounds with their tears?
I shall weep for Romeo's exile until their tears have ceased.
Hark! Retrieve this rope ladder.
He hath fashioned this rope ladder to be a path unto my chamber, yet I am chaste, and shall depart this world as such, a maiden and a widow.
And death, not Romeo, hath the power to steal my maidenhood!
Hie thee to thy chamber.
I shall seek out Romeo to bring thee solace.
I doth knoweth where he doth be.
Hark, thy Romeo shall be present this eve.
I shall hie me to his presence.
He doth conceal himself in the cell of Friar Lawrence.
Romeo, doth emerge.
Hark! Reveal thyself, thou fearful fellow.
Father, prithee, what tidings doth thou bring?
Thou art too knowledgeable in the ways of suffering.
I bear tidings for thee regarding the prince's chastisement.
Doth the prince's punishment be any less awful than the day of doom?
Hark, banishment?
Be kind and pronounce "death." Banishment is far more grievous than death.
Henceforth, speak not of "banishment." Thou art banished from fair Verona.
Thou shouldst be able to endure this, for the world is vast and spacious.
Forsooth, there existeth no world for me beyond the walls of fair Verona, save for purgatory, torture, and the very depths of hell.
To be banished from Verona is akin to being banished from the world, and being banished from the world is death.
To call death banishment is akin to severing my head with a gilded axe and grinning whilst I am slain.
Oh, foul transgression!
Oh, thou impudent and ungrateful knave!
'Tis torture, not mercy.
Flies art haler and more noble and better suited for courtship than Romeo.
Flies may kiss her, but I must away from this fair city.
Flies art like free men, but I hath been banished.
And yet thou dost claim that banishment is not the same as death?
Hadst thou no poison, no keen blade, no weapon to dispatch me swiftly, nothing so ignominious, save for banishment?
Oh friar, accursed souls doth use the term banishment to describe the infernal realm.
They doth lament their exile.
If thou art a member of a divine spiritual order of men who forgive sins, and thou claimest to be my friend, how dost thou find it in thy heart to wound me with the word banishment?
Hark thee, thou foolish madman, lend me thine ear for a moment.
Thy servants did engage in battle with thine enemy's servants ere I did arrive.
I did draw my sword to separate them.
As we did exchange blows, more and more folk did gather to partake in the fray, until the prince did arrive and did disperse the rabble.
Oh, wherefore art thou Romeo?
Hast thou laid eyes upon him this day?
I am joyful that he was not present for this quarrel.
I did approach him, but he did espy me and did conceal himself in the forest.
He hath been spied there many a morn, weeping tears that doth add drops to the morning dew and making a cloudy day even cloudier with his sighs.
But ere the sun doth rise in th' east, my woeful son doth return home to shun the light.
Oh, thou art but going to prate of banishment once more.
Sayeth naught more.
Oh, so thou art also deaf, like a madman.
How should madmen heare, if wise men canst not even see?
Pray, allow me to discourse with thee regarding thy circumstance.
Thou canst not speak of aught that thou dost not feel.
If thou wert as youthful as I, if thou wert in love with Juliet, if thou hadst just wed her an hour hence, if then thou didst slay Tybalt, if thou wert love-stricken as I, and if thou wert banished, then mightest thou speak of it.
Rise from thy slumber.
Hark! Someone doth knock.
Conceal thyself, noble Romeo.
I shall not conceal myself unless the mist of my heartsick groans doth envelop me like fog and hide me from the prying eyes of others.
Wherefore dost thou knock so vehemently?
Whence doth thou hail?
What dost thou desire?
Oh, good friar, oh, pray tell me, good friar, where doth my lady's husband reside?
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?
Oh, he doth acteth just like Juliet, just as she doth.
Oh, wretched sympathy!
She doth lie on the ground, much like him, wailing and shedding tears, shedding tears and wailing.
Rise if thou art truly a man.
For the sake of fair Juliet, for her sake, arise and stand.
Wherefore shouldst thou descend into such a profound lamentation?
Hark, nurse!
Oh, good sir, oh, good sir.
Marry, death doth mark the end for all.
Didst thou speak of fair Juliet?
How fares she?
Wherefore doth she reside?
How doth she fare?
What doth my concealed wife speak of our love, now in shambles?
She doth call my name as if I were a bullet slaying her, even as I did slay her kinsman.
Pray, tell me, good friar, in which part of my body doth my name reside?
Pray, inform me, so that I may extract it from mine own self.
Art thou a man?
Thy untamed deeds doth bear semblance to the irrational fury of a beast.
Thou hast filled me with wonder.
By my sacred oath, I did deem thee to possess greater wit and reason than this.
Hast thou slain Tybalt?
Wherefore dost thou lament thy birth, the heavens, and the earth?
Thou hast such abundant natural talent, yet like one who hoards coin, thou employest none of thy talent for the proper purpose, neither thy body, nor thy love, nor thy mind.
Rise, good sir!
Thy Juliet doth live.
Tybalt did seek to slay thee, yet thou didst slay Tybalt.
Rejoice in thy living.
Thou hast the finest sorts of happiness to partake in.
But, like a misbehaved, sullen wench, thou art lamenting thy ill fortune and thy love.
Go thee to thy love, as it hath been decreed at thy nuptials.
Climbeth up to her chamber and offereth her solace.
Pray, convey my greetings to thy lady, and bid her hasten all within the household to their chambers.
Romeo doth approacheth.
Oh, my lord, I could tarry here all the night, hearkening to such excellent counsel.
Verily, men of learning are most commendable!
Doth so, and bid my fair one prepare to chide me.
Hark, good sir, this ring she did request I deliver unto thee.
Make haste, for the hour grows late.
Verily, this doth bring great comfort unto my soul!
Now, begone from this place.
Hark! Good morrow to thee, fair sir or lady.
Upon this doth everything depend: either make thy exit ere the night watchmen doth take their positions, or depart in disguise after the break of day.
Hie thee to Mantua for a brief respite.
I shall seek out thy servant, and he shall keep thee informed on the status of thy case.
Pray, lend me your hand.
'Tis late.
Hark! I bid thee adieu.
Alas, good sir, fortune hath turned against us, for we have not had the opportunity to persuade our daughter to wed thee.
Hark, she hath great affection for her kinsman Tybalt, and so doth I.
Hark, we all were born to meet our mortal end.
In these times of pain, romance doth suffer greatly.
Fair lady, good eve.
Pray, convey my well wishes to thy daughter.
I shall.
This night, she doth confine herself to her chamber, in solitude with her sorrow.
Sir Paris, I shall make a desperate plea for my child's affection.
Pray, inform her of my son Paris's affection for her.
And hark thee, listen to me, on the morrow, tarry, what day is today?
Morrow, my lord.
Hark! 'Tis the day of Monday!
Hark, hark!
Dost thou thinketh it be a good idea to rush?
We should not have too grand a revelry, we may bid a friend or two.
Hark, for Tybalt hath been slain, and should we hold too grand a revelry, it may be deemed that we hold not his memory in high regard as kinsmen.
Henceforth, we shall have about half a dozen companions to the nuptials, and that is all.
What thinkest thou of Thursday?
My lord, I doth wisheth that Thursday were upon us on the morrow.
Hie thee to thy dwelling.
On Thursday it doth fall, verily.
Art thou going?
Verily, 'tis yet a long time 'til the break of day.
The sound thou didst hear was the lark, the bird that doth sing at dawn, not the nightingale.
Behold, my dearest, what be those streaks of light in the clouds parting in the east?
The night hath passed, and the day doth approach.
That light doth not bear the mark of day, I am certain of it.
'Tis a meteor from the sun to guide thee to Mantua.
Hark, tarry here for a moment.
Thou need'st not depart anon.
Hark! Alloweth me to be captured.
Pray, let me be put to death.
I am satisfied, if it be your desire.
I doth desire to tarry more than I doth desire to depart.
Hither, death, and be thou well received!
Hark, let us engage in discourse.
It is not the light of day.
It doth be, it doth be.
'Tis the lark that doth sing so out of tune, making such harsh noise.
Some doth say the lark doth make a sweet division betwixt day and night.
It be not true, for she doth part us.
The light doth waxeth stronger and stronger.
More and more pain doth afflict us.
Hark! My lady, I beseech thee.
What ho, nurse?
Thy mother doth approach thy chamber.
The day hath broken.
Henceforth, the casement doth admit the morn, whilst life doth depart through yon casement.
Hail and adieu, adieu!
Bestow upon me one sweet kiss, and I shall take my leave.
He doth lock himself away in his chamber, doth close his casements to banish the fair daylight, and doth create for himself a false night.
My noble uncle, dost thou know why he doth act in such a manner?
I know not, and he doth refuse to disclose it unto me.
Hast thou done all thou couldst to make him confess the reason?
I doth hope thou art fortunate enough to heareth the true tale by tarrying here.
Art thou departed thus, my love, my lord?
Oh, by my troth, I shall be many years elder ere I lay mine eyes upon my Romeo once more.
Hark! I bid thee adieu!
I shall not miss any opportunity to dispatch my love unto thee.
Hark, dost thou believe we shall e'er meet again?
Oh, God, my soul doth foretell of wickedness!
Now that thou art down there, thou resemblest one deceased at the bottom of a tomb.
Methinks mine eyes do fail me, or thou dost appear pale.
And hark, my love, thou seem'st pale to mine eyes as well. Trusteth me.
Sadness doth steal our hue.
Farewell, farewell!
Oh fortune, fortune.
Hark! All doth proclaim thou art unable to settle thy thoughts.
I doth hope that perchance thou wilt send him back to his abode anon.
Who doth calleth?
Doth mine own mother approacheth?
For what strange reason doth she have for coming hither?
What ho, Juliet? What tidings doth unfold?
Fair lady, I am not in good health.
Wilt thou weep for thy cousin's demise for all eternity?
Art thou attempting to cleanse him from his grave with thy tears?
If thou couldst, thou couldst not bring him back to life.
Cease thy tears.
A small measure of sorrow doth reveal a great abundance of affection.
Alloweth me to continue mine weeping for such a grievous loss.
Thou wilt feel the loss, but the man thou weep for will feel naught.
In such a manner of feeling the loss, I cannot but weep for him for eternity.
Hark, fair maiden, thou dost not weep for his demise as much as for the villain who hath slain him still doth live.
What knave, lady?
Thou art a villain, Romeo.
Verily, the murderer doth live.
Aye, my lady, he doth lie beyond my grasp.
I doth wish that none but I could seeketh vengeance for my cousin's demise!
Cease thy tears.
I shall dispatch a man to Mantua, where that banished knave doth reside.
And then, I pray, thou wilt be content.
Never shall I be content with Romeo until I lay mine eyes upon him.
Madam, if thou canst procure a man to deliver the poison, I shall mix it myself so that Romeo may peacefully slumber anon upon imbibing it.
I doth desire to taketh the love i had f'r mine own cousin and taketh t out on the body of the man who hath slain him.
Discover the path, and I shall find the suitable gentleman.
Hark! I bring thee joyful tidings, fair maiden.
And 'tis well to have mirth in such a joyless season.
Pray, doth thou inform me.
Hark, hark, thou hast a cautious father, my dear.
Madam, prithee, quickly tell me, what day is this?
Verily, my child, at Saint Peter's church early Thursday morn, the gallant, young, and noble gentleman Count Paris will happily make thee a joyful bride.
Now, by Saint Peter's church and Peter himself, he shall not make me a joyful bride there.
How may I wed him, this husband, ere he comes to woo me?
Pray, inform my father, good lady, that I shall not wed as of yet.
And, when I doth marry, I do swear it shall be Romeo, whom thou knowest I doth hate, rather than Paris.
Verily, that is tidings of great import!
Hark! Thy father doth approach.
Doth thou tell him thyself, and witness how he doth receive the tidings.
What art thou, maiden?
What manner of fountain is this?
Wherefore dost thou still weep?
Hast thou informed her of our decision?
I doth wish the fool were deceased and wedded to her tomb!
How canst this be?
Doth she not take pride in such a union?
Doth she not realize how unworthy she is of the gentleman we have found to be her bridegroom?
But I am grateful that thou hast discovered it.
What ho, what manner of thing is this?
What manner of sorcery is this, that goes by the name of fuzzy logic?
What ho, what manner of thing is this?
Methinks I do hear thee utter "proud" and "I thank thee," and then "nay, I thank thee not" and "not proud," thou spoiled little wench.
Thou dost disgust me, thou puny insect!
Thou art a worthless wench!
Thou art a pale visage!
Thou art shamed!
What, art thou mad?
Good father, I do beseech thee on bended knee, to be patient and hearken to my plea to speak but one thing.
Speaketh not.
Reply not.
Thou shalt not speak in such a manner unto me.
The little hussy doth disgust me!
May the heavens bless her!
My lord, thou art mistaken to chide her in such manner.
Pray, tell me, O wise lady, wherefore?
Go prattle with thy gossiping companions.
I have spoken naught amiss.
Oh, forsooth, by God's grace.
Methinks, may I not speaketh?
Hush, thou prating knave!
We hath no need to heareth it.
Thou art becoming too wrathful.
By the heavens!
It doth vex me sorely.
Day and night, hour after hour, at work, at play, alone, in company, my top priority hath always been to find her a husband.
Thursday doth approacheth.
Place thy hand upon thy heart and hearken to my counsel.
If thou dost comport thyself as my daughter, I shall wed thee to my comrade.
Prithee, ponder upon it.
I shall not break this vow.
Halt this union for a month, or perchance a week.
Or, if thou delay not, make my wedding bed in the tomb where Tybalt lies.
Speak not to me, for I shall not utter a single word.
Do as thou wilt, for I am finished with fretting over thee.
Oh, God! Oh, nurse! How can this be stayed?
My lord doth live upon this earthly plane, whilst my marriage vows doth reside in the heavens above.
How can I bring those promises back down to earth, unless my husband doth send them back down to me by dying and ascending to heaven?
Grant me solace.
Hast thou not a single word of mirth?
Pray, nurse, bestow upon me some solace.
Oh, he doth possess the qualities of a most noble gentleman!
Romeo is but a dishcloth in comparison to him.
Mistress, an eagle hath not eyes as green, as swift, and as fair as the eyes of Paris.
Cursed be my very heart, but methinks thou shouldst find joy in this second union, for it doth surpass thy first.
Though it may not be improved, thy first marriage hath come to an end.
Art thou speaking from thy heart?
Hark! Amen!
What ho?
Hark, thou hast bestowed upon me great solace.
I did provoke my father's wrath, hence I sought Friar Lawrence's cell to make confession and seek absolution.
Hark, I shall.
Oh, thou most wicked fiend!
I am journeying to the friar to seek his counsel.
If all else doth fail, I do possess the power to end my own life.
Pray, on Thursday, good sir?
Verily, that is very anon.
Thou claimeth thou knoweth not the maiden's thoughts.
I doth not fancy it.
Now thou art aware of the cause for the haste.
Hark, good sir, behold, yonder comes the fair lady approaching my prison cell.
I am joyful to make thine acquaintance, my lady and my wife.
Perchance, that may be the truth, good sir.
Hail, cousin, and good morrow to thee.
Is it so early in the morn?
Verily, 'tis but now the ninth hour.
Did my father depart in such haste from this place?
It hath been so.
I lack the thing that doth make time fleet.
Art thou in love?
Henceforth, depart from this place.
Doth thou act out of love?
Pray, wherefore should we break our fast?
Mayhap, love must be on Thursday.
What must be, shall be.
Verily, that is a truth most certain.
Hast thou come to make confession to this father?
If I did answer that query, I would be making a confession unto thee.
Deny not to him that thou lov'st me.
I'll confess to thee that I doth love him.
Thou wilt also confess, I am certain, that thou dost love me.
If I doth so, it shall holdeth more weight if I speaketh it behind thy back than if I speaketh it to thy visage.
Thou pitiful creature, thy visage hath endured many a tear.
Thou hast stolen my visage, and thou hast besmirched it.
I doth have time for thee now, my sorrowful daughter.
May the heavens forbid that I should hinder holy worship!
Oh, Juliet, I doth already know of thy woeful plight.
Methinks I have heard that thou art to be wed to this count on Thursday, and naught can hinder it.
Hark! Do not inform me of this union, good Friar, unless thou canst advise me on how to thwart it.
If thou, who art so wise, cannot assist, I pray thee to deem my solution wise.
Hark, tarry a moment.
Morrow is Wednesday.
On the morrow's eve, ensure thou art in solitude.
Do not permit the nurse to tarry in thy chamber.
Pray, bestow upon me the vial.
Bestow it upon me!
Love shall provide me with the fortitude, and fortitude shall aid me in the execution of this design.
Farewell, my dear father.
Thou shalt not receive any ill cooks from me.
How dost thou test them in such a manner?
Hence, the cooks who cannot lick their fingers are not employed.
Hie thee hence, depart from this place.
We art ill-equipped for this wedding revelry.
Aye, verily, that doth hold true.
Hark, she hath returned from confession with a countenance of joy.
"Good father Lawrence hath bid me to kneel and entreat thy pardon."
Summon the count hither.
Hie thee hence and deliver this message unto him.
Marry, I shall ensure this wedding doth take place on the morrow morn.
I did encounter the young man at Lawrence's cell.
Verily, I am pleased by this news.
Verily, this is most excellent.
Rise, I prithee.
Aye, verily, go forth and fetch him hither, I doth command thee.
Now, before God, our entire city doth owe this friar a great debt.
Nurse, wilt thou accompany me to my chamber and assist me in selecting the attire and adornments I shall require for the morrow?
Nay, not until Thursday.
Plenty of time doth remaineth.
Marry, the wedding shall be held at the church on the morrow.
The night doth approach with haste.
And all shall be well, I do swear to thee, my dear wife.
Thou shouldst go to Juliet and attire her.
I shall not retire to my chamber this eve.
Leave me be.
I shall feign to be the housewife for this occasion.
Aye, verily, those garments be the finest.
What ho, art thou occupied?
Dost thou require my assistance?
I am certain thou hast thy hands full preparing for the sudden festivities.
Good morrow, farewell.
Only doth God know when we shall meet again.
In mine desperate plight, I must needs take action unaccompanied.
Hark, here be the vial.
What ho, if this concoction doth not worketh at all?
Pray, shall I be wed on the morrow morn?
Pray, lie down yonder.
Oh, behold!
Methinks I doth behold the spirit of my kinsman Tybalt.
Hark, Tybalt, hark! Tarry a moment!
Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?
Hark! A beverage for thee.
I doth drink to thee.
Nay, cousin, I do weep.
Hark, good sir, wherefore doth thou weep?
Aye, this is the effect of love.
What other thing is love?
'Tis a sweet confection that doth cause thee to choke.
Farewell, kinsman.
Hark!
I shall accompany thee.
If thou dost leave me thus, thou art doing me a great wrong.
I am not mine own self.
I am not present.
Pray, tell me in earnest, who is the object of your affection?
Dost thou mean I should groan and tell thee?
Doth thou groan?
Nay, not so.
Pray, doth tell me earnestly, who doth it be?
Take these keys and procure more spices, nurse.
They doth call for dates and quinces in the pastry kitchen.
Hark, arise, arise, arise!
The second cock hath crowed.
The bell of curfew hath tolled.
Fret not about the expense.
Depart, thou ancient matron, depart.
Go to thy bed, my dear.
Thou wilt be ill on the morrow for thou hast kept vigil all the night.
I have oft stayed up all night for lesser matters, and ne'er have I fallen ill.
Aye, thou hast been a gallant with the fairer sex in thy days.
Hark! A woman consumed by jealousy, a woman consumed by jealousy!
Hark, good sir, what hast thou there?
Make haste, make haste.
I am cunning enough to seek out the logs on mine own, without troubling Peter.
Hark, thou hast spoken rightly and with great eloquence.
That fellow doth possess a merry wit.
Hark! 'Tis the break of day.
Hark, my dear wife!
What ho?
Hark, nurse!
Hie thee, and rouse fair Juliet from her slumber.
Hie thee and attire her.
I shall go and converse with Paris.
Hark, make haste, make haste!
The bridegroom doth already be present.
Make haste, I do declare.
Hark, my lady!
Hark, mistress!
I wager she doth slumber deeply.
Hark, fair maiden!
Hark, my dear, I do declare!
Hark, fair lady!
My dearest love!
Hark, fair bride!
What ho, dost thou not speak a single word?
Thou shalt now take thy beauty sleep.
How soundly doth she slumber!
Aye, let the count escort thee to thy chamber.
He shall rouse thee from thy slumber, I wager.
Will he not?
What ho! What tumultuous clamor doth resound in this chamber?
Alack, a woeful day!
What ho! What be the matter?
Hark, hark!
Oh, what a day of sorrow!
Oh mine, oh mine!
My child, my reason for living, doth awaken, doth gaze upon me, or I shall perish with thee!
Bring Juliet hither, forsooth, and shame upon thee!
Hark! Her bridegroom doth approacheth.
She hath passed away, she hath departed this mortal coil, she hath breathed her last.
"May the day be cursed!"
"May the day be cursed!"
She hath departed this mortal coil, she hath departed this mortal coil, she hath departed this mortal coil!
Nay!
Pray, let me lay mine eyes upon her.
Oh, fie!
She doth feel the chill.
Her blood hath ceased to flow, and her joints are rigid.
She hath been deceased for a goodly while.
She hath departed this mortal coil, akin to a fair bloom, slain by an untimely chill.
Alack, a woeful day!
Oh, verily, this doth be a time of great pain!
The cruel hand of death, which hath stolen her from me and doth cause me to weep, doth now bind my tongue and doth forbid me to speak.
Pray, is the bride prepared to make way to the church?
She is prepared to depart, yet she shall never come back.
Death hath wedded my daughter.
My inheritance is death.
My daughter hath wedded death.
I shall perish and bequeath all to death.
Life, wealth, and all doth belong to death.
Hath I waited so long to behold this morn, only to witness this?
Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
Verily, this doth be the most wretched hour of all time!
I had but one child, one wretched child, one wretched and loving child, the one thing I had to rejoice and comfort myself, and cruel death hath stolen it from me!
Alas, the agony!
Oh, woeful, woeful, woeful day!
Never hath there been so dark a day as this.
Oh woeful day, oh woeful day!
She hath been deceived, forsaken, done an injustice, scorned, and slain!
Cruel, cruel death hath slain her.
Oh, love! Thou art a wondrous and enchanting force that doth stir the very depths of my soul.
Oh, life! Alas, how thou dost vex me so!
No life doth exist, for my love hath perished!
Despised, distressed, hated, martyred, slain!
Wherefore hath this come to pass at this present moment?
My spirit, not my offspring!
Thou art deceased!
Hush thee, forsooth!
The remedy for bewilderment doth not lie in clamour and outcry.
Thou didst beget this child with the aid of heaven.
Now doth heaven possess her.
She doth reside in a place of greater comfort.
Thou couldst not forestall her eventual demise, but heaven shall bestow upon her everlasting life.
Thou didst most fervently desire her to wed a man of great wealth and ascend the ranks of society, for that was thy vision of paradise.
And dost thou weep, even though she hath ascended beyond the clouds, as high as heaven's own abode?
Oh, in this love, thou dost love thy child so dearly that thou art driven to madness, even though she doth reside in heaven.
'Tis best to wed well and perish young, rather than to be wedded for a lengthy span.
The feast of our wedding shall turn into a mournful burial banquet.
Our joyful songs shall turn to mournful dirges.
Hark! All doth prepare to bear this fair corpse to her final resting place.
Disturb not the heavens by striving against the will of heaven.
Hark, we may stow our pipes and make way to our abode.
Aye, verily, things may improve anon.
Nay, 'tis not a melancholy tune.
Now is not the proper hour for merriment.
Wilt thou not, then?
Nay, not so.
Then will I truly bestow it upon thee.
What wilt thou bestow upon us?
I doth swear by my troth, I have no coin.
I shall dub thee a minstrel.
Then shall I dub thee a lowly serving-creature.
Hark! I shall smite thee upon the pate with the serving-creature's blade.
I shall cause thee to sing.
Hearken unto me, dost thou hear?
Respond to me as men.
Hark, good sir, for silver doth possess a sweet and melodious sound.
Another foolish response!
What sayest thou, James? Well, I know not what to say.
I shall answer for thee.
"Music doth possess a silver sound, for musicians lack the gold to create their melodies."
What a vexing fellow, this knave be!
Forget him, Jack!
If I may trust mine dreams, then some joyful tidings art approaching anon.
Oh, mine eyes!
How sweet 'twould be to actually possess the woman I love, when but the mere thought of love doth bring such joy to me.
Hast thou tidings from fair Verona? What news dost thou bring, Balthasar?
Dost thou bring me a letter from the friar?
How fares my lady?
Doth my father fare well?
How fares my Juliet?
I doth inquire once more, forsooth, for naught can be amiss if she be in good health.
Then she is in good health, and naught is amiss.
Her body doth slumber in the Capulet tomb, whilst her immortal soul doth dwell amongst the angels in heaven.
I did espy her interred in her kin's sepulcher, and thence I hither came to bring thee tidings.
Oh, forgive me for delivering such ill tidings, but thou didst command me to do so, sir.
Thou wouldst not bid a sickly man to "seriously" make his will, for it would only worsen his condition.
Verily, cousin, I doth love a fair maiden.
Thou wert right on target.
The fair maiden whom I doth adore is of exquisite beauty.
The fairest mark is the swiftest struck.
Marry, thou art wide of the mark.
Yea, she hath, and by remaining chaste, she doth squander her fair visage.
She is too fair and too wise to merit heaven's favor by causing me to lament.
Hearken unto my counsel.
Think not of her.
Teacheth me to forget mine own thoughts!
Doth it verily holdeth true?
I doth rebel against thee, oh stars!
Thou dost know where I doth reside.
Fetch me some ink and paper, and procure some steeds for our journey.
I shall depart hence for Verona this very night.
Pray, good sir, have patience.
Thou appearest pale and wild, as if thou art inclined to harm thyself.
Hark, thou art mistaken.
Depart from me and execute the task I have instructed thee to perform.
Hast thou not a letter for me from the friar?
Nay, my noble lord.
It matters not.
Hie thee forth and procure those steeds.
I shall be with thee anon.
Well, Juliet, this night I shall lie with thee.
Let us behold and witness how.
Quickly doth come destructive thoughts to the minds of desperate men!
Methinks, this should be the abode I seek.
Today doth mark a holiday, hence the beggar's shop doth remain closed.
Hark!
Hark! The apothecary!
Who doth call so loudly?
Hither, good sir, hither.
I doth perceive thou art of meager means.
Here be forty ducats.
Art thou so poor and wretched, yet still fearest thou death?
Thine cheeks art gaunt by reason of hunger.
Methinks I can discern in thine eyes that thou art famished.
The world doth not befriend thee, nor doth the law.
The world doth not make laws to fatten thy purse.
I doth compensate thee for thy poverty, not for thy desire to sell me this.
Hark! A holy Franciscan friar!
Hark, brother!
Methinks 'tis the voice of Friar John.
Hail, and well met upon thy return from Mantua.
What sayeth Romeo?
Or, if he hath writ down his musings, bestow upon me his missive.
I could not journey to Mantua, for I was ensnared in that place.
Who hath taken my letter to Romeo?
Oh, wretched fate!
Brother, I shall go and bring it unto thee.
Now must I venture to the tomb in solitude.
In three hours' time, fair Juliet shall awaken.
But I shall send another letter to Mantua, and I shall confine her in my chamber until Romeo doth arrive.
She doth be enclosed within a tomb of a deceased man!
Pray, bestow upon me thy torch, young lad.
Depart from me and keep thy distance.
Extinguish the torch, so I may not be espied.
Pray, bestow upon me those fair blossoms.
Do as I bid thee.
Hie thee hence.
The boy doth warn me that someone doth approacheth.
Who doth spoil my sacred rites of pure affection?
Hark! 'Tis someone with a torch!
I must needs conceal myself in the shadows for a time.
Pray, bestow upon me that pickax and the crowbar.
I shall depart, sir, and trouble thee no more.
That is the manner in which to display unto me thy friendship.
Hark! Receive this.
Hark, fair and valiant youth, provoke not the desperate soul.
Flee from this place and depart from my presence.
Prithee, ponder upon those who hath passed on.
Let them instill fear in thine heart.
I pray thee, young sir, provoke me not to wrath.
Hark, begone!
Do not tarry here, begone.
Live, and henceforth, heed a madman's merciful counsel to flee.
I doth apprehend thee as a villainous knave.
Art thou going to provoke me?
Hark, let us engage in combat, young sir!
Oh, my lord, they doth engage in combat!
I shall go summon the watch.
Hark, I shall.
'Tis the kinsman of Mercutio, the noble Count Paris!
What hath my man spoken?
Methinks he did inform me that Paris hath intentions to wed fair Juliet.
Doth not he speaketh such words?
Or did I dreameth?
I shall inter thee in a splendid sepulcher.
Doth thou seek a grave?
Oh, fie!
Juliet doth lie here, and her beauty doth fill this tomb with light.
Death hath sucked the honey from thy breath, yet it hath not marred thy beauty.
Thou hast not been vanquished.
Oh, what greater favor can I bestow upon thee than to slay the man who hath brought about thy demise with the very hand that hath robbed thee of thy youth.
Should I believe that death hath taken a fancy to thee, and that the dreadful beast doth keep thee here to be his paramour?
Hark, I shall tarry here with the worms that serve as your chamber-maids.
Hark, I shall rest here for all eternity.
Eyes, behold for the final time!
"Arms, give me one final embrace!"
His potions doth work with speed.
Thus, I perish with a tender kiss.
Behold yon fair maidens of beauty.
Saint Francis, lend me thy aid!
How oft this eve hath my aged feet stumbled upon the gravestones!
I am a friend, a friend who doth know thee well.
May the heavens bestow their blessings upon thee!
Pray, my good friend, what be that light yonder?
Methinks it doth appear that it is ablaze within the Capulet's sepulcher.
Who goeth there?
Hark! Romeo doth approacheth.
Forsooth, how many hours hath he tarried in that place?
Forsooth, a full half hour hath passed.
Come with me to the tomb.
I dare not, sir.
Stay thou, then.
I shall venture forth unaccompanied.
I doth suddenly feel a fear.
Oh, I am most fearful that something dreadful hath occurred.
Whilst I lay beneath this yew-tree, I did dream that my master and another did engage in combat, and my master did slay him.
What ho! What be this blood that doth stain the stony entrance of yon tomb?
Hail, good friar!
Wherefore doth my husband tarry?
I doth remember well wherefore I should be, and hither I stand.
Wherefore art thou, my Romeo?
Methinks I doth hear some clamor.
Fair lady, emerge from yon tomb.
A power greater than our own hath thwarted our design.
Hark, hark! Let us away.
Thy husband doth lie dead yonder, and Paris as well.
Hark, I shall bestow thee amidst the sisterhood of holy nuns.
Is it a cup, enclosed in my true love's hand?
Verily, I doth perceive that poison hath been the root of his demise.
I shall bestow a kiss upon thy lips.
Mayhap there doth linger some venom upon them, to bring about my demise with a healing embrace.
Hark, what tumult is this?
Then I shall be swift.
Hark! A dagger, good sir!
Rust within my body and let me perish.
This doth be the place.
Yonder, where the torch doth burn.
The ground doth bear the mark of blood.
Verily, this doth present a pitiable spectacle!
Hie thee, and convey this message to the noble prince.
Hie thee to the house of Capulet.
Awake, Montagues!
Hark, bid some others to search.
Behold, Romeo's servant.
We didst findeth him in the churchyard.
Holdeth him in custody until the prince doth arrive.
Hark! There doth stand a friar, quaking, sighing, and shedding tears.
We didst taketh this pickax and this shovel from him, as he wast walking from yond side of the graveyard.
Methinks he doth bear a most suspicious countenance.
Holdeth the friar also.
What villainy doth occur so early in the morn that I must rouse from my slumber ere the customary hour?
What ails them, that they doth cry out so vehemently?
Hark! Yonder in the street, doth some folk cry "Romeo," and others cry "Juliet," and yet others cry "Paris." They doth all run in a riotous manner towards our tomb.
Investigateeth how this foul murder hath come about.
Oh, ye heavens!
Oh, wife, behold how our daughter doth bleed!
That dagger should be in its scabbard on that Montague's back, but instead it is wrongly sheathed in my daughter's breast.
Oh, mine eyes doth behold such wonder!
This vision of death doth resemble a tolling bell, forewarning me of mine age and imminent demise.
Oh, my lord, my lady hath passed away this very night.
The exile of my son hath caused her breath to cease with sorrow.
What further pain must I endure in mine old age?
Behold, and thou shalt perceive.
And thence I shall be the master of agony, and perchance I shall guide thee unto the very gates of death.
Hark! In the meantime, tarry and have patience.
I am the greatest, yet I was able to accomplish the least.
I have already condemned and excused mine own self.
Pray, doth impart thy knowledge of this matter.
I shall be brief, for my time on this earth is short and I have no desire to bore thee with a tedious tale.
In the meantime, I did send a letter to Romeo, bidding him to hither on this dreadful night, to aid in the removal of her from her temporary tomb, when the sleeping draught hath worn off.
I doth knoweth all of this.
I did bring my master tidings of Juliet's demise.
Pray, give me the letter.
Hark, brother Montague, lend me thine hand.
But prithee, what sayest thou to my entreaty?
I can but reiterate what I have spoken ere this.
My daughter doth still be of tender age.
She hath not yet seen fourteen summers.
Maidens younger than she doth oft wed and become merry mothers.
Maidens who wed at such a tender age doth mature too swiftly.
But prithee, charm her, gentle Paris; woo her heart to love thee.
This eve, I am partaking in a feast that hath been honored for many a year.
Tonight at my lowly abode, thou canst expect to witness dazzling stars that doth walk upon the earth and illuminate the heavens from beneath.
In fair Verona, where our tale unfolds, a feud of ancient grudge between two households breaks into new mutiny, where civil hands make civil hands unclean.
Two hapless children of these warring houses become paramours and doth take their own lives.
Their untimely demise hath brought a conclusion to their parents' long-standing enmity.
Hark! Come hither with me.
Hark! Seeketh the folk whose names doth appear on this scroll?
It hath been writ that cobblers and seamsters should frolic with each other's instruments, that anglers should dabble in pigments, and artists should toy with fishing meshes.
Verily, I have been tasked to seek out the individuals whose names are inscribed upon this scroll, yet alas, I am unable to decipher its contents!
But hark! Hither come some folk, right in the very nick of time.
Forsooth, when thou dost cut thy shin.
What ho?
Romeo, art thou mad?
I am imprisoned and denied sustenance.
I am sorely afflicted and tormented, may the heavens grant thee a fair evening.
Prithee, good sir, dost thou possess the knowledge of reading?
I canst readeth mine own fortune in mine own misery.
Perchance thou hast gained wisdom from experience, not from the pages of a tome.
Pray, doth thou have the ability to decipher all that thou lay thine eyes upon?
Aye, if I doth knoweth the tongue and the letters.
I doth behold.
Hark, that is a stay, good sir.
I can peruse.
Signor Martino and his wife and daughters, Count Anselme and his fair sisters, Vitruvio's widow, Signor Placentio and his lovely nieces, Mercutio and his brother Valentine, my uncle Capulet and his wife and daughters, my fair niece Rosaline and Livia,
"Verily, Signor Valentio and his cousin Tybalt, Lucio, and the lively Helena. Methinks 'tis a fine company of folk."
Whence are they supposed to come?
Hark! Attend to me, forsooth, and mark well the words I speak.
Wherefore art thou?
"Shall we partake in a feast this eve?"
Unto our humble abode.
Whose abode?
The abode of my lord.
Verily, I should have inquired of thee beforehand who he be.
Now will I impart unto thee, so thou need not inquire.
My master is the great and wealthy Capulet, and if thou art not of the house of Montague, I bid thee come and partake in a cup of wine.
Hath a pleasant day!
The fair Rosaline, whom thou dost so dearly love, shall be present at Capulet's traditional feast, along with every comely maiden in Verona.
Hie thee thither and make comparison of her with other maidens I shall present unto thee in an objective manner.
Is there a fairer maiden than my beloved?
Since the world began, the sun hath ne'er beheld a fairer visage than thine own.
I shall accompany thee.
Nurse, wherefore art my daughter?
Pray, bid her hither to my presence.
By my virginity at age twelve, I do swear to thee that I have already bid her come hither.
Hark!
Who doth summon me?
Thy mother.
Hark! I stand before thee, my lady.
What dost thou desire?
Thou art aware of how tender in years my daughter be.
Aye, I doth know her age down to the hour.
She hath not yet seen fourteen summers.
I would wager fourteen of mine own teeth, but alas, I must confess, I possess only four teeth, she is not fourteen.
Be it even or odd, of all the days in the year, on the night of Lammas Eve, she shall be fourteen.
She and Susan, may God rest her and all Christian souls, were born on the same day.
Hark! Fair Susan hath passed on and doth reside with the Almighty.
She was too virtuous for my unworthy self.
Verily, as I did say, on the night of Lammas eve, she shall be fourteen.
Aye, she shall.
Verily, I doth remember it well.
Eleven years hath passed since the earthquake hath struck.
I had placed bitter wormwood upon my breast whilst sitting in the sun, beneath the wall of the dovehouse.
But as I did say, when she did taste the bitter wormwood on my nipple, the fair little babe did become vexed and did commence to quarrel with my breast.
Then did the dovehouse tremble with the earthquake.
There was no need to bid me depart from thence.
Oh, "quoth he, "hast thou fallen on thy visage?
Thou shalt have had thy fill of this.
Pray, hush thy tongue.
Aye, my lady.
But I cannot forbear to chuckle at the thought that the infant ceased its wailing and uttered, "aye." I do vow, she bore a swelling upon her brow as large as a cock's testicle.
'Twas a grievous bruise, and she wept bitterly.
Aye, quoth my husband, didst thou fall upon thy visage?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou growest up, wilt thou not, Jule? " And she ceased her weeping and said, "Aye." Now thou cease too, nurse, I pray thee.
May the heavens bestow upon thee their grace.
Thou wert the fairest babe I ever did nurse.
An if I doth live to see thee wed one day, all mine wishes shall come to pass.
Pray, my daughter Juliet, what say you of the prospect of marriage?
'Tis a great honor that doth not dwell within my dreams.
Hark, beginneth to ponder upon marriage anon.
In fair Verona, there be maidens younger than thou, from noble lineages, who hath already borne children.
Methinks, by my reckoning, I was already thy mother at just about thy age, whilst thou remainest a maiden.
Hark! I shall speak with haste: the valiant Paris doth seek thee as his bride.
Methinks, fair maiden, what a man.
In fair Verona, in the summertime, there is no flower as fine as he.
Doth thou lose aught?
I shall gaze upon him and endeavor to find favor in him, if what I perceive be worthy of favor.
But I shall not permit myself to be ensnared by him beyond the bounds of your consent.
All is in disarray.
Pray, doth follow me directly.
We shall follow thee.
Hark, fair maiden, seeketh a man who shall bestow upon thee merry nights at the conclusion of joyous days.
What excuse shall we proffer for our presence in this place?
Or should we enter without making apology?
'Tis out of fashion to give lengthy explanations such as that.
Let them judge us as they see fit.
Pray, hand me a torch.
I doth not wish to partake in the merriment of dance.
Nay, noble Romeo, thou must needs dance.
Believe me not, I do beseech thee.
Thou art donning dancing shoes with nimble soles.
My soul is fashion'd of lead, and 'tis so weighty it doth keep me fasten'd to the earth, preventing my movement.
Thou art a lover.
Take the wings of Cupid and soar above the common man.
His shaft hath struck me too deeply, so I cannot soar with his merry plumes.
I doth sinketh beneath the burden of love's weight.
We shall not accept their refuse.
I doth strike with great force when mine anger is stirred.
Angry enow to flee.
Thou wilt not stand and engage in combat.
A hound from yon dwelling shall provoke me to wrath, and I shall be compelled to make a stand.
Shouldst thou sink, thou art dragging love down.
Doth love truly possess a tender heart?
Methinks it be too rough, too rude, too rowdy, and it doth prick like a thorn.
If love doth play rough with thee, then play rough in return. Come, let us knock and enter.
Hark! Let mirthful folk with merry hearts prance and frolic.
Hark, we doth waste the precious light of day. Let us away!
Hark! Let us away!
Nay, we art not, for 'tis the night.
We doth intend well by attending this masquerade ball, but 'tis not wise for us to partake.
Pray, may I inquire?
Methought I had a dream yesternight.
I did so as well.
Pray, what was thy dream?
Mine dream hath told me that dreamers oft doth lie.
They doth lie in their bed whilst dreaming of the verity.
Oh, then I perceive thou hast been in the company of Queen Mab?
At times doth she ride o'er a courtier's lips, and he doth dream of making coin off of another.
At times, she doth tickle a priest's nose with a "enough, enough!"
Mercutio, prithee hold thy tongue.
The wind of which thou speaketh doth blow us off our intended course.
The supper hath ended, and we shall arrive too tardy.
Henceforth, my dear lovers!
Strike the drum.
Wherefore doth Potpan reside?
When only one or two men possess all the goodly manners, and yet they be soiled, things are in a sorry state.
Take hence the stools, the sideboards, and the plates.
Hark thee, dear friend, reserve for me a portion of marzipan, and if thou dost hold affection for me, bid the porter admit Susan Grindstone and Nell.
Aye, young sir, I am prepared.
They doth seek thee in the grand chamber.
We cannot be in two places at once, both here and there! 
Huzzah, lads!
Haste thee for a moment, and let the one who doth endure the longest claimeth all.
Hail, good sirs.
Whichever of you doth act shy, I'll swear she hath corns.
Hail, good sirs.
Methinks, it must be thirty years.
It hath been longer, it hath been longer.
The son of Lucentio is elder than that, sir.
He hath seen thirty winters.
Art thou truly going to tell me that?
Two years hence, his son was but a minor.
Methinks, good sir, I know not.
Oh, she doth display the torches how to burn bright!
Mine eyes were deceivers, forsooth, for I ne'er beheld true beauty until this very night.
By his voice, I can discern that this gentleman is of the Montague lineage.
Wherefore art thou so filled with anger?
Uncle, this man is a Montague, our foe.
Pray, is it the youthful Romeo?
Behold, 'tis he, that scoundrel Romeo.
Hark, gentle cousin, prithee be calm.
Leave him be.
He doth comport himself as a dignified gentleman, and, in truth, hath a reputation throughout Verona as a virtuous and well-behaved youth.
I would not deign to insult him in mine own abode for all the riches in this fair town.
Hark! Pray thee, be still.
Simply disregard him.
I shall not abide him.
Thou, uncle, art disrespecting us.
Continue, continue.
Thou art an impudent little knave.
Is that how it be, truly?
I wot what I shall do.
Thou must needs contradict me, dost thou?
I shall instruct thee a lesson.
Doth not saints and pilgrims possess lips as well?
Aye, pilgrim, they possess lips for the purpose of prayer.
Well then, fair saint, let lips perform the same actions as hands.
I pray thee, grant my humble request, lest my faith doth turn to despair.
Saints doth not move, e'en when they do grant prayers.
Then do not stir whilst I doth perform my prayer.
Now hath my sin been lifted from my lips by thine.
Hath my lips now acquired the sin they didst take from thine?
Doth sin floweth from my lips?
Return to me my transgression.
Thou dost kiss as if thou hast studied the art.
Madam, thy mother doth desire to speak with thee.
Who doth be her mother?
I did nurse her daughter, with whom thou wert just speaking.
Hearken unto me, forsooth, the man who doth wed her shall verily amass great riches.
Hark, good sirs, tarry not to depart anon.
We hath a small sweetmeat approaching.
Thou art correct.
The quarrel is betwixt our lords, and we, the men who toil for them.
Verily, it doth remain unchanged.
I shall be a stern master unto them.
"Pray, sever their heads from their bodies?"
Thou dost mean to sever their heads, claim their maidenhood, whatsoever.
Take my remark in whatever sense thou dost please.
The women thou dost violate art the ones who shall bear the "sensibility" of it.
Methinks all doth knoweth i am a gentle piece of flesh.
Thou art fortunate to not be a mere fish.
Thou art to pull out thy tool anon.
I doth have mine naked sword drawn.
Hie thee hither, nurse.
Who be that nobleman?
He is the son and heir of old Tiberio. 
Who is the one that doth depart through yonder door at this present moment?
Marry, that one, methinks, is young Petruchio.
I know not his name.
Pray, go and inquire.
What ho, what manner of thing is this?
What ho?
The strangers hath all departed.
But he hath to make his speeches of love to a woman who is supposed to be his enemy.
And Juliet is just as much in love as he, but she hath even less opportunity to meet her lover.
But love doth grant them strength, and time doth provide the opportunity to encounter, sweetening the perilous with delightful pleasure.
May I depart whilst my heart doth tarry here?
Methinks he hath slipped away and hath gone home to his bed.
He did runneth this way and did leapeth over yond orchard wall.
Summon him, Mercutio.
I shall conjure him as though I were summoning a spirit.
Romeo, wherefore art thou?
Reveal thyself in the guise of a sigh.
Speaketh one rhyme, and I shall be content.
Just exclaim, "Ah, woe is me!" Just utter "love" and "dove." Speak but one fair word to my dear companion.
If he doth hear thee, thou wilt provoke his wrath.
Mine words cannot provoke his wrath.
The words I speak are just and true.
His love doth lack sight, hence it doth dwell in the shadows.
If love be blind, it cannot aim true.
Now he shall sit beneath yonder tree.
There is no point in seeking him if he doth not wish to be discovered.
Behold, yonder lies the east, and Juliet doth shine as the sun.
Virginity doth make her appear pale and envious.
Hark, release it.
Hark! Behold, yonder is my fair lady!
Hark! 'Tis mine own true love.
Oh, would that she knew the depth of my affection for her.
She doth speak, yet doth not utter aught.
What ho?
Her eyes doth speaketh somewhat.
She doth not speak to me.
Two of the brightest stars in the whole sky hath had to depart on business, and they doth beseech her eyes to twinkle in their stead until their return.
Should her eyes be in the night's firmament, they would shine so brightly through yon space that birds would start singing, mistaking her light for the light of day.
Behold how she doth lean her hand upon her cheek.
Oh, how I doth wisheth to be the glove upon yond hand so yond I may toucheth yond cheek.
Oh, my! Verily!
Who art thou?
I doth despise my name, fair saint, for it is the foe of thine.
Art thou Romeo?
Art thou not a Montague?
Pray, how didst thou gain entry into this place?
Wherefore didst thou come?
If any of my kin doth happen upon thee in this place, they shall slay thee for thy very identity.
Hence, thy kinsmen pose no hindrance.
If they doth lay eyes upon thee, they shall commit murder upon thy person.
Just gaze upon me with gentle eyes, and I am impervious to their enmity.
I would give aught to prevent them from beholding thee in this place.
I would rather be slain than live without thy love.
Else, thou wouldst behold me blushing o'er the words thou hast heard me speak this eve.
Dost thou love me?
I doth know thou wilt say "aye," and I shall believe thee.
By what should I swear?
Swear not at all.
But if thou must needs swear, swear by thy wondrous self, which is the god I doth worship like an idol, and then I shall believe thee.
If my heart's sweet love, pray, do not swear.
Thou bringest me joy, yet I cannot partake in the exchange of promises this eve.
Our love, which doth resemble a flower bud in the summer's breath, mayhap shall bloom into a fair flower by our next encounter.
I doth wish thee doth enjoy the same sweet peace and rest that doth reside in mine heart.
Oh, art thou going to leave me so unsatisfied?
What satisfaction couldst thou possibly have this eve?
I did vow my love to thee ere thou didst request it.
Methinks I doth desire to retract that vow, so that I may bestow it once more.
Wouldst thou take it back?
Wherefore wouldst thou commit such an act, my dearest?
Only to be generous and bestow it upon thee once more.
Verily, I doth wish for that which I already possess.
Mine generosity to thee is as boundless as the sea, and mine love is as profound.
Methinks I doth hear a noise within.
Hark, fair Montague, be loyal.
Tarry here for a moment.
I shall return anon.
Oh, thou blessed, blessed night!
Forsooth, as the night doth cloak the land, I doth fear that all this be but a dream, too sweet to be true.
Three words, sweet Romeo, and then 'tis truly goodnight.
Fret not for me.
Let us not transgress the law by engaging in fisticuffs.
Let them commence a matter.
I shall scowl upon them as they doth pass, and they may respond as they please.
Thou dost mean however they dare.
I shall bite my thumb at them.
Hark, art thou biting thy thumb at us?
I doth bite my thumb.
Art thou biting thy thumb at us?
Art thou attempting to commence a quarrel?
Wouldst thou engage in combat?
Nay, good sir.
Morrow I shall dispatch the messenger.
My soul doth depend on it, a thousand times good night.
Parting from thee is a thousandfold more grievous than being in thy presence.
Oh, how I doth wisheth I could maketh mine own soul doth call out mine own name.
The sound of lovers' names being called through the night is as sweet as silver.
Romeo, hark!
Doth my little hawk?
At what hour on the morrow should I dispatch a messenger unto thee?
By the hour of nine.
I shall not fail.
From hence to thence doth seem like twenty winters.
I have forgotten wherefore I did summon thee hither.
Pray, let me tarry here until thou dost recall thy wits.
I shall forget that I have any dwelling besides this very place.
The morn is nigh.
He doth permit the bird to hop a little from his hand, and then doth he yank him back by a string.
I doth wisheth I wast thy bird.
My sweet, I do so as well.
Verily, I would slay thee with excessive caresses.
Good morrow, good morrow.
Parting is a sorrow so sweet that I shall bid thee good night until the morrow doth come.
I doth wish thee a peaceful slumber.
I doth wish to be in slumber and tranquility, so that I may pass the night in thy company.
Now will I go see my priest, to seek his aid and recount my fortune.
Darkness doth stumble out of the sun's path like a drunken knave.
Ere the sun doth rise and scorch the dew, I must gather this basket with venomous herbs and healing blooms.
The earth doth serve as nature's mother and nature's tomb as well.
From the womb of the earth, doth spring forth many diverse kinds of plants and animals, and the earth doth bestow upon her offspring many excellent varieties of sustenance.
Great power doth possess herbs, plants, and stones.
There is naught on this earth so vile that it doth not bestow upon the earth some unique virtue.
If virtue be misused, it doth turn to vice.
Within the small rind of this feeble flower, doth lie both venom and potent remedy.
In all things, be they men or herbs, there doth exist two opposing elements, good and evil.
When wickedness doth reign, death doth swiftly claim the body, like unto a cancer.
Hail, father, good morrow to thee.
May the heavens bestow their blessings upon thee.
Who doth greeteth me so early in the morn?
Young sir, something doth amiss if thou art rising from thy slumber at such an early hour.
Methinks every elder hath his troubles, and troubled men ne'er find rest, yet young men should bear no burden in this world.
They should retire to their chambers betimes and partake in ample slumber.
Hence, the truth that thou art awake so early doth inform me that thou hast been troubled with some anxiety.
If that be not so, then this must be the truth: thou, Romeo, hast not slept this night.
Thy final conjecture is accurate.
I did partake in a rest more sweet than slumber.
Doth Rosaline, father?
That is well, my young sir.
But wherefore hast thou been?
Ere thou need'st inquire again, I shall impart the knowledge unto thee.
Thou hast the sacred power to cure us both.
I bear no enmity, good sir, for my plea shall bring advantage to mine adversary.
