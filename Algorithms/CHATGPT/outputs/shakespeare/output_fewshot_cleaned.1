A tangled confession can but receive a tangled absolution.
I doth love fair Capulet's wealthy daughter.
We are bound in every possible way, save for the need of thy hand in marriage.
I shall recount anon the time and place of our meeting, the manner in which our hearts did entwine, and the vows we did exchange. But for now, I do beseech thee: consent to join us in matrimony this very day.
Holy Saint Francis, this doth mark a drastic alteration!
Hast thou so soon forsaken fair Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dearly?
Then doth young men love with their eyes, not with their hearts.
The groans thou didst once utter still doth ring in mine ancient ears.
Thy cheek doth still bear a mark from a tear of old, which hath not yet been cleansed.
If thou wert ever thyself, and this sorrow was thine, thou and thy sorrow were all for Rosaline.
And now hast thou altered?
Then repeat this after me: Thou canst not expect women to be faithful when men are so unreliable.
Thou hast chided me oft for loving Rosaline.
I chid thee for fixating on her, not for loving her, my pupil.
And thou didst bid me inter my affection.
I bid thee not to cast off one love and take another in her place.
I prithee, I beseech thee, do not chide me.
The other maiden did not hold affection for me.
Oh, she knew full well thou didst feign affection without understanding the true essence of love.
But hark, thou fickle youth, come hither with me.
Let us away from this place.
I am in haste.
Go thou wisely and with measured pace.
Those who do haste do trip and take a tumble.
Wherefore can Romeo be, by the devil's name?
Came he not home yesternight?
Not to his father's abode.
I did inquire of a servant.
That fair-skinned, hard-hearted wench, Rosaline, shall plague him until he doth go mad.
Tybalt , kinsman to old Capulet , hath dispatched a missive to the abode of Romeo's sire .
I wager 'tis a challenge.
Romeo shall meet the challenge.
"Any man who hath the skill to wield a quill may respond to a missive."
Nay, Romeo shall answer the sender of the letter, declaring whether he doth accept the challenge.
Oh , wretched Romeo !
Is he man enough at this point to encounter Tybalt?
Pray, what tale hath Tybalt to tell?
What does he know?
He doth appear lean, like a withered herring sans its roe, and he hath lost his maiden fair.
O flesh , flesh , thou hast turned pale and weak like a fish.
Now he is prepared for.
Hail to thee, both!
What mean'st thou by accusing me of feigning?
Thou hast given us the slip, sir, the slip.
Canst thou not comprehend the words that doth escape my lips?
The right is mine own.
My master is as virtuous as thine.
But his is not superior to mine.
Hark! Well then.
Thou speakest falsely.
Gregory, doth thou remember how to wield thy blade?
What ho?
Come, Benvolio, break this up.
I am losing this contest of wit.
Continue on, continue on, or I shall proclaim myself the victor.
Thou hast more wild goose in one of thy jests than I have in five of mine.
Was I e'en in thy near pursuit of the goose?
Thou wert never with me for aught if thou wert not there for the goose.
I'll nip thee on the ear for that jest.
Nay, fair fowl, do not peck at me.
Thy jest is a most bitter apple.
Thy wit is a pungent condiment.
Then is it not the proper dish for a fair goose?
Oh, that jest is a leather prating, stretching itself from a mere inch to a yard's girth.
I do extend my jest for that word "fat." If thou doth append that word to the word "goose," it doth reveal thou art a fat goose.
Wherefore, is not all this jesting finer than lamenting o'er love?
Thou art now sociable.
Thou art now Romeo.
Thou art mistaken.
I would have made it brief.
I had come to the deepest part of my tale, and I purposed to speak no more on the matter.
Hark! Here be something of goodly nature.
There be twain, a man and a woman.
Peter, hark!
I am at your command.
Hark! Fetch me my fan, Peter.
Hail, good morrow, sirs.
Hail, fair lady, good morrow to thee.
Doth the sun now stand in the afternoon?
It is not ere than that, I doth tell thee.
Hence, begone from this place!
What manner of man art thou?
I am a man, my lady, whom God hath fashioned for his own undoing.
I do swear, thou speak'st the truth.
"For himself to bring about his own downfall," he doth proclaim.
Gentlemen, prithee can any of you inform me where I may chance upon young Romeo?
I can tell thee, but young Romeo shall be elder when thou dost find him than he was when thou didst commence thy search for him.
I am the youngest man by that name, for there is none younger, nor more wretched.
Thou speakest with great eloquence.
Is the worst in good health?
Verily well taken, I doth believe, very wise.
She will be a bawd!
I have discovered it.
What hast thou discovered?
Art thou bound for thy father's house for the midday meal, Romeo?
Hark! Let us hie thither.
I shall pursue thee.
He doth speak more in a minute than in a month.
If he doth speak against me, I shall humble him, even if he were stronger than he is, and twenty ruffians like him.
If I cannot accomplish it on mine own, I shall seeketh another who hath the ability.
Thou filthy knave!
I am not one of his wanton wenches.
I am not one of his base companions who bears a blade.
I did not espy anyone employ thee for sport.
If mine eyes had beheld such a sight, I would have swiftly drawn my blade.
Believe me, I'll draw my sword as swift as any other man if I spy a fray beginning and the law doth favor me.
Now , I do swear , I am so enraged that I do tremble all o'er.
Thou knave of foul repute!
Nurse, convey my humble salutations to thy mistress.
I do swear to thee, thou hast a noble heart, and trust me, I shall convey that message unto her.
"Good my lord, good my lord, she shall be a joyful lady."
What tidings wilt thou bear to her, Nurse?
Thou art not attending to me.
At Friar Lawrence's cell, she may make her confession and be joined in holy matrimony.
Hark, good nurse, tarry!
Within an hour, one of my men shall approach thee behind the abbey wall and deliver unto thee a rope ladder.
Farewell.
Be truthful and aiding, and I shall recompense thee for thy labors.
Farewell.
Sing my praises unto thy mistress.
May the heavens above bless thee with God's grace.
Hark, I pray thee, good sir, lend me thine ear.
What hast thou to say, my dear nurse?
Can thy man keepeth a secret?
Hast thou ne'er heard the adage, "two may plot to put one away"?
I do assure thee, my man is as true as tempered steel.
Well , sir , my mistress is the sweetest dame.
"Good my lord, when she was but a babe, oh, there is a nobleman in the city, a gentleman hight Paris, who would fain lay claim to her."
I do incense her sometimes by saying that Paris hath more comeliness than thou dost.
But when I doth say so, I do swear she doth turn as pale as a ghost.
"Yea, nurse, what tidings bring'st thou of that?"
They both start with the letter "r." Ah, thou jester, that is the hound's title.
Deliver my regards unto thy lady.
Aye, a thousandfold.
Peter, hark!
I am prepared.
I did dispatch the nurse at the hour of nine.
Mayhap she cannot espy him.
That cannot be.
Oh, she doth move at a snail's pace!
Love's messengers should be swift thoughts, which doth fly ten times faster than the beams of the sun.
'Tis three hours since the ninth hour hath struck, yet she hath not returned.
If she were youthful and full of passion, she would move as swift as a sphere.
My words would rebound her to my sweet love, and his words would rebound her back to me.
But many elders doth comport themselves as if they be already departed, languid, tardy, corpulent, and devoid of hue, like unto lead.
Oh sweet nurse, what tidings dost thou bring?
Hast thou spoken to him?
Send thy man hence.
Peter, tarry for me at the gate.
Now, good sweet nurse, oh lord, wherefore dost thou wear such a sorrowful countenance?
Even if the tidings be woeful, doth tell me with a countenance of mirth.
If the tidings be fair, thou dost mar the sweetness with thy sour countenance and jests.
I am wearied.
Leave me be for a moment.
Oh my, my bones doth ache so sorely.
I do wish thou hadst my bones, and I had thine tidings.
Canst thou not tarry for a moment?
Dost thou not perceive that I am out of breath?
How canst thou be out of breath when thou hast enough breath to tell me thou art out of breath?
The excuse thou mak'st to tarry the tidings is longer than the tidings themselves.
What tidings doth the messenger bring? Art they of joy or sorrow?
Answereth that query.
Pray, inform me if it be good or ill, and I shall tarry for the particulars.
Pray, do tell me so that I may be content.
Is it fair or foul?
Well, thou hast made a foolish election.
Thou knowest not how to choose a man.
Art thou Romeo?
Nay, not he, though his visage be fairer than any man's, and his limbs more comely, and as for his hands and feet and body, they are not much to boast of, and yet they are matchless.
He is not the most courteous man in the world, but, trust me, he is as gentle as a lamb.
Hark, do as thou wilt.
Be thou virtuous.
Hast thou taken thy midday meal?
Nay, I have not broken my fast.
All thou hast told me, I already knew.
What sayeth he of our union?
What sayest thou of that?
My pate doth throb.
My back doth ache as well,
Believe me, I do lament thy anguish.
Hark, hark, hark, dear nurse, prithee, what spake my love Romeo?
Thy love doth speak, like a noble sir, who is courteous, kind, fair, and, I doth think, virtuous. Where doth reside thy mother?
Wherefore doth my mother tarry?
Wherefore, she doth reside within.
Where else would she be, pray tell?
Thy response is most queer!
Thy love doth inquire, as a noble sir, "Where doth thy mother reside?"
Art thou so impatient?
Come hither, thou art being absurd!
Is this the remedy for my aching bones?
Henceforth, attend to thine own missives.
Thou art making such a clamor.
Hark, what did Romeo utter?
Hast thou leave to go forth and make thy confession this day?
I doth.
Then make haste and speed to Friar Lawrence's cell.
Yonder stands a husband, ready to take thee as his wife.
Now do I behold the crimson tide rushing to thy cheeks.
Thou dost turn crimson at the sound of any tidings.
Hie thee to the church.
Thy love shall use it to ascend unto thy casement whilst it be dark.
Hie thee hence.
I shall to dinner hie.
Thou art to Friar Lawrence's cell.
I do but seek to maintain the tranquility.
Either stow thy sword or wield it in aid to cease this fray.
What ho?
I do despise the word peace as I do abhor hell, all Montagues, and thee.
Let us at it, thou craven!
Hark! Employ thy clubs and spears!
Smite them!
Smite them low!

What tumult is this?
I doth desire my trusty blade.
Old Montague doth stand here, brandishing his sword to vex my soul.
Thou Capulet, thou knave!
Thou art not advancing one step towards a foe.
Wish me good fortune.
I thank thee, sweet nurse.
Hark, hark! Amen, amen.
But whatsoever misfortunes doth befall, they cannot taint the joy I doth feel with but one glance upon her visage.
Hence, let us love each other with temperance.
That, my dear, is the secret to love enduring.
"Too swift is as ill as too tardy."
Hark! The lady doth approach.
Oh, a footfall as delicate as hers shall ne'er withstand the rugged path of life.
Such flimsy and unreal pleasure doth be.
Romeo shall give thee thanks, my maiden, for the both of us.
I'll render him due gratitude, so our debts are settled.
Ah, Juliet, if thou art as joyful as I, and thou art more skilled in speech, doth describe to me the bliss thou dost envision for our union.
I canst imagine more than I canst speak, I hath more on my mind than words.
Hark, hark! Come hither with me, and swiftly shall we execute the task.
I do entreat thee, good Mercutio, let us bid the day adieu.
Thou art like unto those fellows who doth enter a tavern, doth slam their sword upon the table, and then doth declare, "I pray I never have need of thee." Ere he doth call for his second drink, he doth draw his sword upon the barkeep without cause.
Am I truly akin to one of those fellows?
Come hither, thou canst be as wrathful as any man in Italy when thou art so inclined.
And what sayest thou of that?
If there were two men like thee, anon there'd be none, for the twain of you would slay each other.
Wouldst thou engage in combat with a man if he hath one whisker more or one whisker less in his beard than thou hast in thine own beard?
Thou wilt engage in combat with a man who doth crack nuts simply because thou hast eyes the color of hazelnuts.
Only thou wouldst seeketh a quarrel such as that.
Thy pate is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of yolk, but it hath been beaten like scrambled eggs from so much brawling.
Thou didst provoke a quarrel with a man for coughing in the street, for he did disturb a sleeping dog in the sun.
Didst thou not contend with thy tailor for wearing one of his new suits ere the proper season?
And with another for fastening the new shoes he fashioned with old laces?
And yet thou art the one who doth seek to instruct me in the art of temperance!
If I were wont to engage in combat as thou art, my premiums for life assurance would soar to the heavens.
What ho, thy life's assurance?
That is a folly.
Hark! Behold, the Capulets approacheth.
Hark, hark, I doth not care.
"Thou art as lovely as a summer's day, and as fair as the rose in bloom. Thy beauty doth outshine the stars in the night sky, and thy grace doth rival the gentle breeze that caresses the meadow. Together, we shall conquer all obstacles that dare to stand in our way."
Make it a word and a blow.
Thou shalt find me ready enow to do so, sir, if thou givest me cause.
Canst thou not find a cause without my yielding one unto thee?
Mercutio, thou dost consort with Romeo.
"Loiter about? Who dost thou think we art, minstrels in a troupe?"
If we appear as minstrels to thee, thou mayst anticipate naught but clamor.
We do converse in this public space.
Either hie thee to a private chamber, or discourse with reason, or else begone from my sight.
Out yonder doth all behold our presence.
Men's eyes were fashioned to behold, therefore let them gaze.
I shall not budge to please any man.
Hark, may peace be with thee.
Hark! Hither comes my man, the man I seeketh.
He is not thy man.
Tybalt, I have a cause to love thee that doth permit me to set aside the fury I should feel and pardon that affront.
I am no knave.
Farewell, adieu.
I can discern thou know'st not who I be.
Boy, thy words cannot excuse the harm thou hast wrought upon me.
So now, turn and draw thy sword.
And so, good Capulet, which is a name I cherish as mine own, thou shouldst be content with my words.
This tranquil acquiescence is dishonourable and base.
What dost thou desire from me?
Wilt thou draw thy sword from its scabbard?
Haste thee, or I shall smite thee upon thine ears with my sword ere thou hast drawn thine own.
I'll engage thee in combat.
Put away thy sword, noble Mercutio.
Let us away, Tybalt.
I have been wounded.
May a pestilence curse the lineages of both thee and thine.
I am done.
Hath he escaped unscathed?
What , art thou injured ?
"But 'tis sufficient."
Wherefore doth my page tarry?
Be of good cheer, good sir.
The wound cannot be so dire.
Nay, it is not as profound as a well, nor as broad as a church door, but it sufficeth.
Inquire for me on the morrow, and thou shalt discover me in a sepulcher.
I am undone in this world, I doth believe.
May a pestilence befall upon both thy dwellings.
I cannot believe that cur, that vermin, that rodent, that feline could scratch me to my demise!
That braggart, punk villain who fights as if he hath learned swordplay from a book!
Wherefore didst thou come betwixt us?
He hath smote me from beneath thine arm.
Methought it was the proper deed to undertake.
Take me within some dwelling, Benvolio, or I shall swoon.
May a pestilence befall upon the households of both thee and thine!
They have transformed me into sustenance for the earthworms.
I am undone.
Curse thy kin!
Oh Romeo, Romeo, valiant Mercutio hath met his end!
Hark! The furious Tybalt doth approach once more.
He doth live and hath triumphed, and Mercutio doth lie dead?
Either thou, or I, or both of us must accompany him.
Thou wretched boy, thou didst consort with him here, and thou shalt ascend to heaven with him.
This combat shall determine who shall meet their end.
Romeo, depart hence from this place.
The citizens doth surround, and Tybalt hath met his end.
Do not stand there in astonishment.
The prince shall bestow upon thee the penalty of death shouldst thou be apprehended.
Hence, depart from this place!
Wherefore dost thou tarry?
"Whither did the man who slew Mercutio pass?"
Tybalt, that knave, which way did he flee?
Yon Tybalt doth lie.
Speak, nephew, speaketh.
Wert thou present when it did commence?
Wherefore art the knaves who did commence this fray?
Oh, noble prince, I can recount to thee all the woeful happenings of this deadly fray.
He hath slain thy kinsman, valiant Mercutio, and then young Romeo hath slain him.
Tybalt was mine own kinsman!
He was my brother's son! 
Oh kinsman, kinsman!
Benvolio, who did provoke this fray?
Hark! Romeo did cry, "Hold, my companions."
Then did he leap betwixt them and compel them to lower their blades.
Ere I could part the fray, Tybalt hath been slain.
Romeo did flee when Tybalt did fall deceased.
Benvolio is of the Montague kin.
He doth not speak the truth.
There were twenty Montagues engaged in this dire fray, and yet those twenty together could only slay one man.
Thou, O prince, art the one who can grant me justice.
Romeo hath slain Tybalt.
Romeo must needs meet his end.
Romeo hath slain Tybalt.
Who shall now bear the cost for Mercutio's breath?
His offense hath done justice's duty by taking Tybalt's breath.
I am entangled in thy feud.
I shall chastise thee so severely that thou shalt rue the loss thou hast brought upon me.
I will not hearken to thy entreaties nor thy apologies.
Thou canst not escape trouble by praying or weeping, so trouble not thyself.
Remove this mortal form, and obey my command.
Granting mercy to murderers doth but breed more bloodshed.
Or else, love is blind, and its prime is in the night.
I doth wish for night to come, like a widow clad in mourning, so that I may learn to yield to my husband and lose my maidenhood.
Let the crimson tide that floods my visage be stilled.
Hie thee, night, come hither.
Hither, Romeo, come.
Thou art whiter than the snow upon the black wings of a raven.
His visage shall make the heavens so fair that the world shall fall in love with the night and forget the gaudy sun.
Is that the rope ladder Romeo bid thee to fetch?
Aye, aye, this be the rope ladder.
Hark, what tidings doth thou bring?
Wherefore dost thou wear such a troubled visage?
"He hath shuffled off this mortal coil."
We art undone, fair lady, we art undone!
How dreadful a day!
Can God be so envious and full of hate?
Romeo doth bear hate, though God doth not.
What manner of devil art thou to torment me thus?
This is as foul as the torments of Hades.
Hath Romeo slain himself?
Say "aye" and I shall turn more venomous than the serpent with the wicked gaze.
If he hath been slain, say "aye." If not, say "nay." These brief words shall shape my bliss or my anguish.
I'll send mine eyes to prison, and they shall ne'er be free to gaze upon aught more.
I'll render my base body back to the dust.
Oh, Tybalt, Tybalt, he was the dearest comrade I possessed.
I do wish I had not lived long enough to witness his demise.
Hath Romeo been slain, and doth Tybalt lie dead as well?
Tybalt was mine own dearest kinsman.
Tybalt hath met his end, and Romeo hath been exiled.
Oh god, hath Romeo's hand spilled Tybalt's blood?
It hath, it hath.
Curse the day this hap'd, but it hath.
Oh , he doth resemble a serpent cloaked in the guise of a fair blossom.
Hath a dragon e'er lurked in so fair a den?
He is a raven with the plumage of the gentle dove.
Oh nature, what wert thou doing in hell?
Hath there ever been such a wicked tome with such a fair binding?
Ah, wherefore doth my servant tarry? Bring me some brandy. These woes, these aches, these sorrows doth age me.
Shame be upon thee, Romeo!
I pray that sores doth cover thy tongue for such a wish!
He was not born to bear shame.
He doth merit naught but honor, full honor.
Oh, I was a wretched creature to be enraged at him.
Art thou going to speak well of the man who hath slain thy kinsman?
But wherefore, thou knave, didst thou slay my kinsman?
Perchance, forsooth, my kinsman, the knave, would have slain my lord.
Hark! All this doth bring comfort to mine ears.
Wherefore, should I weep?
I would fain forget it, but it doth burden my memory as sins do haunt guilty minds.
"Tybalt hath met his end, and Romeo hath been exiled."
That exile is more grievous than the slaying of ten thousand Tybalts.
Tybalt's demise would be dire, if that were the extent of our woes.
It would have been better if, after she spake, "Tybalt's dead," she did inform me that my mother or my father, or both, were departed.
But to declare Tybalt's demise and then proclaim, "Romeo hath been exiled." To utter such is akin to pronouncing that my sire, my dame, Tybalt, Romeo, and Juliet all lie in their graves, they are all deceased.
"Romeo hath been exiled." that tidings bringeth infinite demise.
"Naught can articulate the anguish within."
Where be my father and my mother, nurse?
They do weep and wail o'er Tybalt's lifeless form.
Art thou to join them?
I shall convey thee thither.
Art they washing out his wounds with their tears?
I'll weep my tears for Romeo's exile when their tears are spent.
Hark! Take up this rope ladder.
He hath fashioned this rope ladder to be a thoroughfare to my bedchamber, yet I am a maiden, and I shall perish as such, untouched and widowed.
And death, not Romeo, shall take my maidenhood!
Hie thee to thy chamber.
I'll seek out Romeo to bring thee solace.
I doth know where he doth reside.
Hark, thy Romeo shall be present this eve.
I shall wend to him.
He doth lurk within Friar Lawrence's cell.
Romeo, emerge forth.
Come forth, thou fearful man.
Father, prithee, what tidings doth thou bring?
Thou art too well acquainted with the pangs of woe.
I bear tidings for thee concerning the prince's chastisement.
Is the prince's chastisement any less dreadful than the day of judgment?
Ha , exile?
Be kind and utter "death." Banishment is far more grievous than death.
Say not "banishment." Henceforth, thou art exiled from fair Verona.
Thou shouldst be able to endure this, for the world is vast and spacious.
There is no world for me beyond the walls of fair Verona, save for purgatory, torment, and the very depths of hell.
To be exiled from fair Verona is akin to being banished from the entire globe, and to be banished from the entire globe is to meet with death.
To call death banishment is like severing my head with a gilded axe and grinning whilst I am slain.
Oh, foul transgression!
Oh, thou impudent and ungrateful knave!
'Tis torment, not pity.
Flies are more hale, more virtuous, and more apt for courtship than Romeo.
Flies may kiss her, but I must away from this fair city.
Flies art akin to freemen, yet I am exiled.
And yet thou sayest that banishment is not the same as death?
Didst thou possess no venom, no keen blade, no weapon to swiftly end my life, naught but banishment, a shameful fate?
Oh friar, accursed spirits doth employ the term banishment to depict the infernal realm.
They doth lament their exile.
If thou art a member of a holy brotherhood of men who pardon transgressions, and thou claim'st to be my comrade, how canst thou find it in thy heart to wound me with the cruel decree of exile?
Hark thee, thou foolish knave, lend me thine ear for a moment.
Before I arrived, thy servants were engaged in combat with the servants of thine enemy.
I drew my blade to separate them.
As we did exchange our blows, more and more did join the fray, until the prince arrived and did disperse the throng.
Oh , wherefore art thou Romeo?
Hast thou laid eyes upon him this day?
I am joyful that he was not present for this fray.
I did approach him, but he did espy me coming and did conceal himself in the forest.
He hath been seen there many a morn, weeping tears that doth add drops to the morning dew, and making a cloudy day more cloudy with his sighs.
But as soon as the sun doth rise in the east, my woeful son doth hie him home to shun the light.
Oh, thou art but going to prate of exile once more.
Speak not of aught else.
Hark! Art thou also deaf, thou madman?
How should lunatics hearken, if sages cannot even behold?
Hearken unto me, I prithee, that I may discourse with thee concerning thy plight.
Thou canst not speak of aught thou dost not feel.
If thou wert as young as I , if thou wert in love with Juliet , if thou hadst just wed her an hour since , if then thou slew'st Tybalt , if thou wert lovesick as I , and if thou wert banished , then might'st thou speak on it .
Arise, thou sluggard.
Hark! Someone doth knock.
Conceal thyself, good Romeo.
I will not skulk unless all the mist from my heartsick groans doth envelop me like fog and doth conceal me from people's searching eyes.
Wherefore dost thou knock so vehemently?
From whence dost thou hail?
What dost thou desire?
Oh, good friar, oh, pray tell me, good friar, where doth my lady's husband reside?
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?
Oh, he doth mimic fair Juliet, even as she doth.
Oh, sympathy that doth cause such agony!
She lies upon the ground, even as he doth, wailing and weeping, weeping and wailing.
Arise if thou art truly a man.
For Juliet's sake, for her sake, arise and stand thee up.
Wherefore shouldst thou descend into so profound a lamentation?
Nurse, attend!
Ah, good sir, ah, good sir.
Well , death is the final fate for all.
Didst thou speak of fair Juliet?
How fares she?
Where doth she reside?
How fares she?
What doth my covert spouse speak of our love in ruins?
She doth call my name as if I were a bullet slaying her, even as I did slay her kinsman.
Tell me, good friar, in which part of my body doth my name reside?
Pray, do tell me, so I may cut it from my very being.
Art thou a man?
Thy wild actions doth resemble the irrational fury of a beast.
Thou hast filled me with wonder.
By my sacred order, I did deem thee wiser and more rational than this.
Hast thou slain Tybalt?
Wherefore dost thou lament thy birth, the heavens, and the earth?
Thou hast such abundant natural gift, yet like one who hoards coin, thou employest none of thy talent for rightful purpose, neither thy body, nor thy love, nor thy mind.
Arise, good sir!
Thy Juliet doth live.
Tybalt did seek thy death, yet thou didst slay Tybalt.
Rejoice that thou art living.
Thou hast the finest joys to revel in.
But like a misbehaved, sullen wench, thou art lamenting thy ill fortune and thy love.
Go thee to thy love, as it was decreed at thy nuptials.
Climb yon to her chamber and bring solace to her troubled soul.
Hie thee to thy lady and bid her hasten all within the house to their beds, and give her my salutations.
Romeo doth approacheth.
O lord, I could tarry here all the night, hearkening to such wise counsel.
"Verily, men of learning doth present a most impressive sight!"
Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide me.
Here, good sir, this ring she did request me to deliver unto thee.
Haste thee, for the hour grows late.
Verily, this doth bring great solace unto my soul!
Now, begone from this place.
Hark! Good morrow to thee.
Everything doth depend on this: either be gone ere the night watchmen do take their stations, or depart in disguise after the break of day.
Hie thee to Mantua for a brief respite.
I shall seek thy servant, and he shall keep thee informed on thy matter as it doth stand in this place.
Bequeath me thy hand.
The hour grows late.
Hence, I bid thee adieu.
Alas, good sir, fortune hath dealt us such ill luck that we have not had the opportunity to persuade our daughter to wed thee.
Hark, she held great affection for her kinsman Tybalt, and so did I.
Well , we all were born to meet our end.
These times of anguish are ill-fated for love.
Farewell, fair lady.
Give my salutations to thy daughter.
I will perform it.
Tonight she doth confine herself within her chamber, solitary with her melancholy.
Hark, Sir Paris, I shall make a desperate plea for my child's affection.
Inform her of my son Paris's affection towards her.
Hark thee, and hearken to me, on Wednesday, tarry, what day is it today?
Monday, my liege.
Monday, thou art the first day of the week!
"Ha , ha !"
Dost thou think it a good notion to hasten?
We should not have too grand a revelry, we may bid a friend or twain.
Hearken, for if Tybalt hath been slain, folk may deem us indifferent to his memory as kin if we hold too grand a revel.
Hence, we shall have about half a score of friends to the nuptials, and that is all.
What thinkest thou of Thursday?
My liege, I doth desire Thursday to be upon us on the morrow.
Hie thee home, I bid thee.
Thursday it be, then.
Art thou going?
It is yet a long time until the break of day.
That sound thou heard'st was the lark, the bird that sings at dawn, not the nightingale.
Hark, my love, what be those streaks of light in the clouds parting in the east?
The night hath waned, and the day doth approach.
That light is not the day, I do perceive it.
'Tis some meteor emerging from the sun to guide thy path to Mantua.
So tarry for a moment.
Thou need'st not depart anon.
Haply, I am taken captive.
Hence, let me be put to death.
I am satisfied, if that be thy desire.
I doth desire to tarry more than I doth desire to part.
Hither, death, and be thou welcome!
Hark, let us converse.
'Tis not the hour of day.
It doth be, it doth be.
'Tis the lark that doth sing so out of tune, making such harsh noise.
Some do say the lark doth make a sweet division betwixt day and night.
It is not so, for she doth part us.
More and more doth the light increase.
More and more agony doth befall us.
Thou art a lady of great beauty and grace.
What sayest thou, nurse?
Thy mother doth approach thy chamber.
The day hath broken.
Then doth the casement admit the day, and thus doth life depart through yonder window.
Hail and adieu, adieu!
Bestow upon me one sweet kiss, and I shall depart anon.
He doth lock himself away in his chamber, doth close his casements to shut out the fair daylight, and doth fashion for himself a false night.
My noble uncle, dost thou know wherefore he doth comport himself thus?
I know not, and he doth refuse to disclose it unto me.
Hast thou done all thou couldst to make him confess the cause?
I pray thou art fortunate enough to hearken the true tale by tarrying here.
Art thou departed thus, my love, my lord?
Oh, by this reckoning, many years shall pass ere I lay mine eyes upon my Romeo once more.
Hail and farewell!
I shall not miss any opportunity to dispatch my affection to thee.
Oh, dost thou think we shall e'er meet again?
Oh god, my soul doth foretell of dire omens!
Now that thou art down there, thou resemblest one deceased in the depths of a sepulcher.
Methinks either mine eyesight doth fail me, or thou dost appear pale.
And trust me, my dear, thou seem'st pale to mine eyes as well.
Sadness doth steal our hue.
Farewell, adieu!
Oh fortune, fortune.
Everyone doth say thou canst not make up thy mind.
I do pray that thou wilt speedily dispatch him homeward.
Who goes there, making such a clamor?
Is it my mother, perchance?
What strange cause could she have for hither coming?
What ho, Juliet? What tidings doth unfold?
Fair lady, I am not in good health.
Wilt thou weep for thy cousin's demise for all eternity?
Art thou attempting to cleanse him from his grave with thy tears?
If thou couldst, thou couldst not bring him back to life.
Cease thy tears.
A small measure of sorrow doth reveal a great abundance of affection.
Let me continue to weep for such a grievous loss.
Thou shalt feel the loss, but the man for whom thou weep'st shall feel naught.
Feeling the loss like this, I cannot choose but weep for him perpetually.
Well, maiden, thou weep'st not for his demise as much as for the truth that the knave who slew him doth still draw breath.
What knave, lady?
That knave, Romeo.
That is for the reason that the slayer doth live.
Aye, lady, he doth lie beyond my grasp.
I do wish that none but I could seek revenge for my cousin's demise!
Cease thy weeping.
I'll dispatch a messenger to Mantua, where that banished knave doth dwell.
And then, I pray, thou wilt be contented.
I shall never be content with Romeo until mine eyes doth behold him.
Lady, if thou canst procure a man to bear the venom, I shall myself blend it, so that Romeo may peacefully slumber anon upon quaffing it.
I doth desire to take the love i had for my cousin and wreak it upon the body of the man who hath slain him.
Discover the path, and I shall find the proper gentleman.
But now I bear joyful tidings for thee, maiden.
And 'tis good to have mirth in such a joyless season.
Pray, doth thou inform me.
Well, well, thou hast a cautious father, my dear.
Madam, prithee, quickly tell me, what day doth that be?
Verily, my child, at Saint Peter's church on the early morn of Thursday, the gallant, young, and noble gentleman Count Paris will gladly take thee as his joyful bride.
Now , I do swear by Saint Peter's church and Peter too, he shall not make me a joyful bride there.
How can I wed him, this husband, ere he comes to woo me?
Pray, convey to my father, good lady, that I shall not wed at this time.
And , when I do wed , I do swear , it shall be Romeo , whom thou know'st I do detest , rather than Paris .
Verily, that is tidings of great import!
Hark! Thy father doth approach.
Tell him so thyself, and mark how he doth receive the tidings.
What art thou, maiden?
What manner of fountain is this?
Wherefore dost thou still weep?
Hast thou informed her of our resolution?
I would fain the fool were deceased and wedded to her tomb!
How can this be? - How canst this be?
Is she not proud of such a match?
Doesn't she perceive the lack of worthiness in her to be the bride of the gentleman we have chosen for her?
But I am grateful that thou hast discovered it.
What ho! What manner of thing is this?
What manner of fuzzy logic is this?
What ho! What manner of thing is this?
I do hear thee say "proud" and "I thank thee," and then "no thanks" and "not proud," thou spoiled little wench.
Thou dost disgust me, thou puny insect!
Thou art a worthless wench!
Thou pallid countenance!
Shame be upon thee!
What , art thou mad ?
Good father, I do beseech thee on my bended knee, have patience and hearken to my single plea.
Speak not a word.
Answer not.
Thou shalt not speak in contradiction to me.
She doth disgust me, the little hussy!
Heaven's blessings upon her, God!
My lord, thou art mistaken to chide her in such manner.
And wherefore, O prudent dame?
Go prattle with thy gossiping companions.
I have spoken no ill.
Oh, for the love of heaven.
Can I not speak aught?
Be still, thou prating fool!
We have no need to hearken to it.
Thou art becoming too wrathful.
By God's wounds!
It doth incense me.
Day and night, hour by hour, at labor, at sport, in solitude, in fellowship, my chiefest aim hath ever been to procure for her a spouse.
Thursday doth approacheth.
Place thy hand upon thy heart and hearken to my counsel.
If thou dost behave as my daughter, I shall wed thee to my comrade.
Ponder upon it.
I shall not break this vow.
Delay this marriage for a month, or a fortnight.
Or , if thou dost not tarry, make my nuptial bed in the tomb where Tybalt rests.
Speak not to me, for I shall not utter a single word.
Do as thou wilt, for I am finished with fretting over thee.
Oh god! , oh nurse, how may this be stayed?
My lord doth live on this earthly sphere, whilst my marriage vows doth reside in the heavens.
How can I bring those promises back to earth, unless my husband doth send them down to me by dying and ascending to heaven?
Bestow upon me solace.
Hast thou not a single word of mirth?
Grant me some solace, good nurse.
Oh, he doth possess the qualities of a fair and noble gentleman!
Romeo is but a dishclout to him.
Lady, a noble eagle hath not eyes as green, as swift, and as beauteous as the eyes of Paris.
Curse my very heart, but methinks thou shouldst rejoice in this second union, for it doth surpass thy former.
Even if it be not better, thy first marriage is ended.
Art thou speaking from thy heart?
Hark! So be it!
What ho?
Hark! Thou hast bestowed upon me great solace.
I did incense my father, hence to Friar Lawrence's cell I went, to make confession and seek absolution.
Hark, I shall.
Oh, that most foul demon!
I shall to the friar go, to seek his remedy.
If all else doth fail, at the least I possess the power to end mine own life.
On Thursday, good sir?
'That is very anon.'
Thou sayest thou knowest not what the maiden doth think.
I doth not fancy it.
Now thou art privy to the cause of the haste.
Hark, sir, behold the lady approacheth yonder, making way unto my humble abode.
I am joyful to make thy acquaintance, my lady and my spouse.
"Perchance, good sir, it may be so."
Hail, cousin, good morrow.
Is it so soon in the morn?
The hour hath scarce struck nine.
Was it my father who did depart in such haste from this place?
It was a dark and stormy night, with the wind howling like a banshee and the rain lashing against the windows.
I lack the substance that doth make time take wing.
Art thou in love?
Out, out, brief candle!
Art thou acting out of love?
Wherefore shall we break our fast?
That "may be" must be, my love, on Thursday.
What must be shall be.
Verily, that is a truth most certain.
Hast thou come to make confession to this father?
If I did respond to that query, I would be making a confession unto thee.
Do not deny to him that thou lov'st me.
I'll confess to thee that I doth love him.
Thou wilt also confess, I am certain, that thou dost love me.
If I do so, it will carry more weight if I speak it behind thy back than if I speak it to thy visage.
Thou pitiful wretch, thy visage hath endured many a weeping.
Thy visage is mine, and thou hast maligned it.
I do have leisure for thee now, my woeful daughter.
Heaven forbid that I should hinder holy worship!
Oh, Juliet, I am already privy to thy woeful plight.
I do hear that thou art to be wed to this count on Thursday, and naught can hinder it.
Do not tell me thou hast heard of this marriage, Friar, unless thou canst instruct me on how to thwart it.
If thou, who art so wise, cannot aid, then be so kind as to deem my resolution wise.
Hold, then.
On the morrow, Wednesday doth approach.
On the morrow's eve, ensure thou art in solitude.
Do not suffer the nurse to tarry in thy chamber.
Grant me the phial.
Bestow it upon me!
Love shall lend me power, and power shall aid me in achieving this design.
Farewell, sweet father.
Thou shalt not receive any ill chefs from me.
How canst thou test them in such a manner?
So those cooks who cannot lick their fingers are not employed.
Hence, depart from this place.
We are ill-equipped for this nuptial revelry.
Aye, that be true.
Behold, she hath returned from confession with a countenance full of joy.
Holy father Lawrence hath bid me to kneel and entreat thy pardon.
Hie, summon the noble count hither.
Hie, go and bear him tidings of this.
I'll ensure this wedding doth take place on the morrow morn.
I did encounter the young man at Lawrence's cell.
Hark! I am joyful of this news.
This doth please me well.
Arise, stand thee up.
Aye, verily, go forth and fetch him hither, I bid thee.
Now , before God , our entire city doth owe this friar a great debt.
Nurse, wilt thou accompany me to my chamber and aid me in selecting the garments and adornments I shall don upon the morrow?
Nay, not until Thursday.
There is an abundance of time.
Morrow we shall hold the wedding at the church.
The night doth approach with haste.
And all shall be well, I do vow to thee, my dear wife.
Thou shouldst hie thee to fair Juliet and attire her.
I shall not retire to my chamber this eve.
Leave me be.
I'll feign to be the goodwife for this once.
Yea, verily, those garments be the finest.
What , art thou occupied ?
Dost thou require my aid?
I am certain thou hast thy hands full preparing for the sudden revels.
Fare thee well, good night.
Only the heavens know when we shall meet again.
In my dire circumstance, I must needs go forth unaccompanied.
Hark! Here be the vial.
What if this concoction doth not work at all?
Shall I be wedded on the morrow's morn?
Lie thee down right there.
Oh, hark!
methinks i doth behold the spirit of my kinsman, Tybalt.
Hark, Tybalt, hark!
Romeo, Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou, Romeo?
Hark! Here's a quaff.
I drink to thee.
Nay, cousin, I do weep.
Pray, good sir, wherefore dost thou weep?
Aye, this is what love doth.
What other thing is love?
'Tis a sweetmeat that doth choke thee.
Farewell, kinsman.
Hark!
I shall accompany thee.
If thou depart from me in such a manner, thou art committing a grievous injustice against me.
I am not mine own self.
I am not present.
Pray, tell me in earnest, who is the object of thy affection?
Dost thou mean I should lament and disclose to thee?
Art thou groaning?
Thou art a knave, and I shall not endure thy company any more.
Pray, doth tell me in earnest, who doth it be?
Take these keys and fetch more spices, good nurse.
They doth call for dates and quinces in the pastry kitchen.
Hark thee, arise, arise, arise!
The second cock hath crowed.
The curfew-bell hath tolled.
Fret not o'er the expense.
Go, thou ancient dame, go.
Get thee to thy chamber, sweet one.
Thou wilt be ill on the morrow for thou hast kept vigil all the night.
I have kept vigil many a night for lesser causes, and ne'er have I fallen ill.
Aye, thou hast been a gallant with the ladies in thy day.
A woman consumed with jealousy, a woman consumed with jealousy!
Hark, good sir, what hast thou there?
Haste thee, haste thee.
I am wise enough to seek the logs on mine own, without troubling Peter.
Hark, thou speak'st right and well.
That fellow doth possess a merry wit.
Good morrow, the sun doth shine.
My fair lady!
What ho?
Hark, nurse!
Hie thee, and rouse fair Juliet from her slumber.
Hie thee and attire her.
I'll hie me hence to converse with Paris.
Hark, make haste, make haste!
The bridegroom doth already hither come.
Haste thee, I bid thee.
Hark, mistress!
Hark, mistress!
Methinks she doth slumber deeply.
Hark, fair maiden!
Hark, my dear, I do declare!
Hark! Lady!
My dearest love!
Hark, bride!
What ho, dost thou not utter a single word?
Thou tak'st thy beauty sleep anon.
How soundly doth she slumber!
Aye, let the count receive thee in thy chamber.
He will rouse thee, I wager.
Wilt he not?
What tumult is this within?
Oh , woeful day !
What ails thee?
Hark, hark!
Oh , what a woeful day !
Oh, mine eyes, mine eyes!
My offspring, my cause for being, arise, cast thine eyes to the heavens, or I shall perish with thee!
Forsooth, bring Juliet hither in shame.
Her bridegroom doth hither come.
She is departed, she is no more, she is deceased.
Curse the day! - > Curse the day!
Curse the day! - > Curse the day!
She is deceased, she is deceased, she is deceased!
Nay!
Hark, let me lay mine eyes upon her.
Oh, fie!
Her body doth feel the chill of winter's breath.
Her blood hath ceased, and her joints are rigid.
She hath been deceased for a goodly while.
She's deceased, like a fair bloom, slain by an untimely frost.
Oh, woeful day!
Oh, this doth be a time of great anguish!
Death, which hath snatch'd her hence to make me weep, doth now bind up my tongue and doth forbid me speech.
Hark, is the bride prepared to journey to the church?
She is prepared to depart, yet she shall never come back.
Death is my kinsman.
Death is the sole inheritor of my estate.
My daughter hath wedded death.
I shall perish and bequeath death all.
Life, riches, all doth belong to death.
Hath I waited so long to behold this morn, only to witness this?
O cursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
Verily, this hour is the most wretched of all time!
I had but one issue, one wretched issue, one wretched and affectionate issue, the one thing I had to delight and solace myself, and ruthless death hath snatched it from me!
Oh, the agony!
Oh woeful, woeful, woeful day!
Never hath there been so dark a day as this one.
Oh woeful day, oh woeful day!
She hath been beguiled, forsaken, injured, scorned, slain!
Cruel , cruel death hath slain her.
O love!
Oh life, thou art a fickle and cruel mistress!
There is no life, but my love is deceased!
Despised, distressed, hated, martyred, slain!
Wherefore did this have to betide at this present moment?
My spirit, and not my offspring!
Thou art deceased!
Hush thee, for shame!
The remedy for bewilderment lies not in clamor and outcry.
Thou hadst this child with the aid of heaven.
Now doth heaven possess her.
She doth reside in a more blessed abode.
Thou couldst not stay her from her mortal end, but heaven shall grant her life eternal.
The utmost thou didst hope for was for her to wed a wealthy suitor and ascend the social hierarchy, that was thy vision of paradise.
And now thou dost weep, even though she hath ascended beyond the clouds, as lofty as heaven itself?
Oh, in this love, thou dost love thy child so sorely, that thou art driven to madness, even though she doth reside in heaven.
It is better to wed nobly and perish young, than to be yoked for a lengthy span of time.
Our nuptial feast shall turn to funeral pomp.
Our joyful hymns shall turn to mournful funeral dirges.
Hark, all doth ready to bear this fair corpse to her final resting place.
Disturb not the heavens further by striving 'gainst the will of heaven.
Well, we can stow our pipes and make way to our abode.
Aye, verily, things mayhap improve.
Nay, not a woeful ballad.
'Tis not the proper hour for sport.
Wilt thou not, then?
Thou art a knave, and I shall not endure thy company any more.
Then will I truly bestow it upon thee.
What wilt thou bestow upon us?
I doth swear by my troth, I have no coin.
Thou art a minstrel, I shall call thee.
Then will I dub thee a menial.
Then I'll smite thee on the pate with the serving-creature's knife.
I shall make thee sing.
Hear'st thou me?
Answer me like men doth.
Well , sir , for silver hath a sweet sound .
Another foolish response!
What sayest thou, James? Well, I know not what to say.
I shall respond in thy stead.
It is "music with her silver sound," for musicians have no gold to make their music.
What a vexing fellow, this knave be!
Forget him, Jack!
If I may trust mine dreams, then some joyful tidings doth approach anon.
Oh my word!
How sweet 'twould be to have the woman I do love, when mere thoughts of love doth bring such joy unto my heart.
Hast thou tidings from fair Verona, Balthasar? What news dost thou bring?
Bring'st thou a letter from the friar to me?
How fares my lady wife?
How fares my father?
How fares my Juliet?
Pray, ask that again, for naught can be amiss if she be in good health.
Then she is in good health, and naught is amiss.
Her mortal frame doth rest in Capulet's tomb, whilst her immortal spirit doth dwell amongst the angels in the heavens.
I did behold her interred in her kin's sepulcher, and thence I hither came to bring thee tidings.
Oh , forgive me for bearing this ill tidings , but thou didst charge me with this duty , sir .
Thou wouldst not tell a sick man he "seriously" hath to make his will, it would but make him worse.
Verily, cousin, I doth love a fair maiden.
Thou wert then spot on in thy aim.
The fair maiden whom I do adore is of exquisite beauty.
A fair mark is the one that doth receive the swiftest blow.
Well, thou art wide of the mark.
Yea, she hath, and by remaining chaste, she doth squander her fair visage.
She is too fair and too wise to merit heaven's grace by causing me to lose hope.
Harken to my counsel.
Think not upon her.
Teach me to unlearn the art of thought!
Is it verily sooth?
Then I doth rebel against thee, O celestial bodies!
Thou knowest where I doth reside.
Fetch me some ink and parchment, and procure some steeds for our journey.
I shall depart hence for Verona this very night.
Pray, good sir, have patience.
Thou seem'st pale and wild, as if thou art bent on harming thyself.
Hark, thou art mistaken.
Depart from me and execute as I have instructed thee.
Hast thou not a letter for me from the friar?
Nay, my noble lord.
"Be it as it may."
Hie thee forth and procure those steeds.
I shall be with thee anon.
Well, Juliet, this night I'll lie with thee.
Let us witness how it doth unfold.
Destructive thoughts doth swiftly come to the minds of men in despair!
Methinks, if my memory serves me right, this should be the dwelling.
Today is a holiday, hence the beggar's shop is closed.
Hark!
Apothecary!
Who goes there making such a clamorous noise?
Hither, good fellow, come hither.
I do perceive thou art in poverty.
Here be forty ducats.
Art thou so wretched and poor, yet still fearful of death?
Thy cheeks are gaunt by reason of hunger.
I can perceive in thine eyes that thou art famished.
The world doth not befriend thee, nor doth the law.
The world doth not fashion laws to make thee wealthy.
I do compensate thee for thy poverty, not for thy desire that I purchase this.
Hark! Franciscan friar of holy order!
Brother , ho!
That doth sound like the voice of Friar John.
Hail from fair Mantua, thou art returned.
What sayeth Romeo?
Or, if he did set down his musings, then hand me his epistle.
I could not journey to Mantua for I was ensnared in that place.
Who bore my missive to young Romeo's hand?
Unhappy fortune! - Unfortunate fate!
Brother, I shall hie and fetch it for thee.
Now must I to the tomb alone.
Within three hours, fair Juliet shall awaken from her slumber.
But I'll send again to Mantua, and I'll keep her in my chamber until Romeo doth arrive.
She's enclosed within a tomb of the deceased!
Pass me thy torch, lad.
Depart from me and keep thy distance.
Extinguish the torch, so I may not be espied.
Grant me those fair blossoms.
Do as I bid thee.
Hie thee hence.
The boy doth warn me that someone doth approacheth.
Who doth disturb the sacred rites of my true affection?
Hark! 'Tis someone with a torch!
I must needs conceal myself in the shadows for a time.
Grant me that pickax and the crowbar.
I shall depart, sir, and trouble thee no more.
That is the manner in which to exhibit friendship towards me.
Hark! Take this.
Hark, good and noble youth, provoke not one in desperate straits.
Begone from this place and depart from my presence.
Ponder upon those who have shuffled off this mortal coil.
Let them instill fear in thy heart.
I pray thee, young sir, provoke me not to wrath.
Get thee hence!
Do not tarry here, begone.
Live, and henceforth, proclaim that a lunatic did kindly bid thee flee.
I do hereby apprehend thee as a villainous knave.
Art thou going to provoke me?
Hark, let us engage in combat, knave!
Oh lord, behold! They doth engage in combat!
I shall go summon the watch.
Hark, I shall.
It is the kinsman of Mercutio, the noble Count Paris!
What did my knave utter?
methinks he did inform me that Paris is to wed fair Juliet.
Is't not what he hath spoken?
Methought or was I in a slumber?
I shall inter thee in a splendid sepulcher.
What manner of tomb?
Alack, alas!
Juliet doth lie here, and her beauty doth fill this tomb with radiant light.
Death hath drawn the sweetness from thy breath, yet hath it not marred thy fair visage.
Thou hast not been vanquished.
Oh, what better favor can I do for thee than to slay the man who hath caused thy untimely death with the very hand that didst make thee depart this world in thy youth.
Should I believe that death hath taken thee as his paramour, and doth keep thee here as his mistress, thou awful monster?
Here, here I'll tarry with worms that serve as your chambermaids.
Oh, I shall take my rest in this place for eternity.
Eyes, gaze out for the final occasion!
Arms, take your final embrace!
His potions doth work with speed.
So with a kiss, I die.
Behold other fair maidens.
Saint Francis, aid me!
How oft this eve hath my aged feet stumbled upon the graves!
I am a comrade, a comrade who knows thee well.
May the blessings of God be upon thee!
Pray, tell me, my good friend, what be that light yonder?
It seemeth to mine eyes as if it doth burn within the Capulet's sepulcher.
Who goes there?
Romeo, wherefore art thou?
How long hath he tarried yonder?
For the space of a full half hour.
Come with me to the sepulcher.
I dare not, sir.
Stay, then. = Tarry, then.
I shall venture forth unaccompanied.
I am struck with sudden fear.
Oh, I am very fearful that something dreadful hath occurred.
As I lay beneath this yew-tree yonder, I dreamt that my master and another did engage in combat, and my master did slay him.
What ho! What meaneth this blood that doth stain the stony entrance of yonder tomb?
Oh, kind friar!
Wherefore doth my lord husband tarry?
I do remember well where I ought to be, and lo, here I stand.
Wherefore art thou, my Romeo?
Methinks I doth hear some clamor.
Fair lady, emerge from yon sepulcher.
A mightier force than we can combat hath thwarted our design.
Hie thee, hie thee hence.
Thy husband doth lie dead yonder, and Paris as well.
Come hither, I shall bestow thee amidst the sisterhood of sacred nuns.
Is it a goblet, enclosed within my true love's grasp?
Verily, I perceive that poison hath been the agent of his demise.
I will plant a kiss upon thy lips.
Mayhap there doth linger some venom upon them, to bring about my demise with a healing touch.
Hark, what clamor?
Then will I be swift.
Oh , good , a dagger !
Rust within my frame and let me perish.
This be the place.
Yonder, where the torch doth burn.
The earth is besmirched with blood.
This doth present a woeful spectacle!
Hie thee, and bear tidings to the prince.
Hie to the house of Capulet.
Awake, Montagues, awake!
Hark, bid some others to seek.
Behold, Romeo's servant.
We did encounter him in the churchyard.
Hold him in custody until the prince doth arrive.
Behold, a friar who doth tremble, sigh, and weep.
We did take this pickax and this shovel from him, as he did walk from yonder side of the graveyard.
Methinks thou art full of suspicion.
Hold yon friar fast.
What villainy doth transpire so early in the morn that I must rouse from my slumber ere the accustomed hour?
What ails them, that they doth cry out so vehemently?
Hark! In the street, there be those who do cry "Romeo," and others who do cry "Juliet," and yet others who do cry "Paris." They do all run in open riot towards our tomb.
Investigate how this foul murder hath come about.
O, ye celestial beings!
Oh wife, behold how our daughter doth bleed!
That dagger should rest in its scabbard on that Montague's back, but instead it is wrongly sheathed in my daughter's breast.
Oh my word!
This vision of death doth ring like a bell, foretelling mine age and imminent demise.
Oh , my sovereign , my lady hath passed away this eve .
Sadness o'er my son's banishment did stay her breath.
What further anguish must I endure in my elder years?
Behold, and thou shalt see.
And then shall I be the sovereign of agony, and perchance I shall guide thee even unto the gates of death.
In the interim, hold fast, and bear with patience.
I am the greatest, yet I did accomplish the least.
I have already censured and absolved mine own self.
Pray, do tell us what thou knowest of this matter.
I'll be brief, for my time on this earth is too short to waste on a tedious tale.
In the interim, I did scribe to Romeo and bid him hither on this dire night to aid in the removal of her from her temporary tomb when the slumbering draught hath worn away.
I am privy to all of this.
I did bring my master tidings of Juliet's demise.
Bestow upon me the missive.
Oh, brother Montague, extend thy hand to me.
But what say'st thou to my entreaty?
I can but reiterate what I have spoken previously.
My daughter is yet in her tender youth.
She hath not yet seen fourteen summers.
Girls younger than she oft wed and become joyful mothers.
Maidens who wed at such tender age doth mature too swiftly.
But go thee on and charm her, gentle Paris; woo her heart to love thee.
This night I hold a feast, a tradition we have kept for many a year.
At my lowly abode this eve, thou shalt behold sparkling stars that doth tread the earth and illuminate the heavens from beneath.
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, an ancient grudge between two households breaks forth into new mutiny, where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
Two hapless children of these warring houses become lovers and do take their own lives.
Their untimely demise did quell their parents' strife.
Hie thee with me.
Pray, wherefore seek the folk whose names doth grace this scroll?
It is writ that cobblers and seamsters should sport with each other's implements, that anglers should sport with pigments, and artists should sport with angling meshes.
But I have been dispatched to seek out the folk whose names are inscribed upon this scroll, and I am unable to peruse!
But hark! Hither come some folk, right in the very moment.
Forsooth, when thou dost cut thy shin.
What ho?
Romeo, art thou mad?
I am imprisoned and starved within these walls.
I am lashed and tormented, may the heavens grant thee a fair eve.
Prithee, sir, dost thou know how to peruse?
I can read mine own fortune in mine own misery.
Perchance thou hast gained wisdom from life's lessons, not from the pages of books.
Pray, do tell me, canst thou read aught that thou dost behold?
Yea, if I am acquainted with the tongue and the characters.
Methinks I perceive.
Hark, that is a halt, good sir.
I have the skill to peruse.
Signor Martino and his wife and daughters, Count Anselme and his fair sisters, Vitruvio's widow, Signor Placentio and his beauteous nieces, Mercutio and his brother Valentine, my uncle Capulet and his wife and daughters, my fair niece Rosaline and Livia,
"Signor Valentio and his cousin Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena. Verily, a fair company of gentlefolk."
Whither are they meant to arrive?
"Up, up, and away to the heavens doth my spirit soar."
Whither doth thou go?
Art thou ready for the evening meal?
Hither to our abode.
Whose dwelling?
My master's abode.
Verily, I should have inquired of thee beforehand who he be.
Now will I impart to thee, so thou need'st not inquire.
My lord is the noble and wealthy Capulet, and if thou art not of the house of Montague, pray, come and partake of a cup of wine.
Have a fair day!
The fair Rosaline, whom thou dost so adore, shall grace Capulet's ancient feast, along with every beauteous maiden in fair Verona.
Hie thee thither and compare her dispassionately to some other maidens I'll present to thee.
Is there a fairer maiden than my beloved?
"Ne'er hath the sun beheld a fairer visage since the world's creation."
I shall accompany thee.
Nurse, wherefore is my daughter?
Bid her come hither unto me.
By my virginity at twelve years old, I do swear I have already bid her come.
Hark thee!
Who doth summon me?
Thy mother.
Hark, lady, I am present.
What dost thou desire?
Thou knowest how tender my daughter's years be.
Yea, I doth know her age down to the hour.
She hath not yet seen fourteen summers.
I'd wager fourteen of mine own teeth, but alas, I do confess, I possess only four teeth, she is not fourteen.
Whether it be even or odd, of all the days in the year, on the night of Lammas Eve, she shall be fourteen.
She and Susan, God rest her and all Christian souls, were born on the selfsame day.
Well , Susan hath passed and doth reside with God.
She was too virtuous for me.
Verily, as I did say, upon the night of Lammas Eve, she shall be fourteen.
Aye, she shall.
Verily, I do recall it with great clarity.
It hath been eleven years since the earthquake hath shaken our land.
I had placed bitter wormwood upon my bosom whilst I did sit in the sun, beneath the wall of the dovehouse.
But as I did say, when she did taste the bitter wormwood upon my nipple, the pretty little babe did grow irritated and did commence to quarrel with my breast.
Then did the dovehouse tremble with the earthquake.
There was no need to bid me depart from thence.
"Oh, didst thou fall upon thy visage?" he inquired.
Thou shalt have had thy fill of this.
Hush thee, I pray.
Aye, my lady.
But I cannot refrain from mirth at the thought that the infant ceased its wailing and spake, "aye." I do vow, she bore a swelling upon her brow as vast as a cock's stone.
It was a grievous bruise, and she did weep bitterly.
Aye, quoth my husband, didst thou fall upon thy visage?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou grow'st up, wilt thou not, Jule? " And she ceased her weeping and said, "Aye." Now do thou cease as well, nurse, I pray thee.
May the grace of God be upon thee, chosen to receive his favor.
Thou wert the fairest babe I e'er did nurse.
If I do live to see thee wed one day, all my desires shall be fulfilled.
Pray, my daughter Juliet, what say'st thou about the prospect of marriage?
It is an honour that doth not visit my slumber.
Hark, begin to ponder on marriage anon.
In fair Verona, there be maidens younger than thou, maidens of noble birth, who have already borne children.
By my reckoning, I was already a mother at your tender age, whilst thou dost still remain a maiden.
Hark! I'll speak briefly: the noble Paris seeks thee as his bride.
Thou art a man, fair maiden.
In fair Verona, in the summer's prime, there blooms no flower as fair as he.
Doth naught lose?
I'll gaze upon him and endeavor to find favor in him, at least if what I behold is worthy of favor.
But I will not let myself fall for him beyond the bounds of your consent.
All is in disarray.
I pray thee, do walk in my footsteps without deviation.
We shall hie after thee.
Go, maiden, seek a man who will grant thee joyful nights at the conclusion of joyful days.
What shall we proffer as our plea for our presence in this place?
Or shall we enter without making amends?
It is out of fashion to give such lengthy explanations.
Let them pass judgment upon us as they will.
Grant me a torch.
I have no desire to partake in the dance.
Nay, noble Romeo, thou must needs take to the floor and dance.
Believe me not, I pray thee.
Thou art donning dancing shoes with nimble soles.
My spirit is fashioned of lead, and it doth weigh so heavily that it doth keep me fastened to the earth, unable to stir.
Thou art a lover.
Take Cupid's wings and soar above the common man.
His shaft hath pierced me too deeply, so I cannot soar with his merry plumes.
I doth sink beneath the burden of love's weight.
We shall not accept their refuse.
I do smite with great force when my wrath is kindled.
Angry enow to flee.
Thou wilt not stand and engage in combat.
A hound from yon dwelling doth provoke me to such ire that I must needs make a stand.
If thou dost sink, thou art dragging love down.
Doth love truly possess a tender heart?
I deem it too harsh, too uncivil, too boisterous, and it doth sting like a thorn.
If love doth play rough with thee, then play rough in return. Come, let us knock and enter.
Let merry folk with merry hearts doth dance.
Hark, we do waste the precious light of day.
Hark! Let us away!
Nay, we art not, for 'tis the night.
We doth intend good by attending this masquerade ball, but 'tis not wise for us to partake.
Wherefore, may I inquire?
Methought I had a dream yesternight.
I did as well.
Hark, what was thy dream?
My vision hath told me that dreamers oft doth speak false.
They doth lie in their bed whilst they doth dream of verity.
Oh, then I see thou hast been in the company of Queen Mab?
At times she doth ride o'er a courtier's lips, and he doth dream of making coin off of another.
Sometimes doth she tickle a priest's nose with a "enough, enough!"
Hush, Mercutio, hold thy tongue.
The wind of which thou speak'st doth blow us from our intended path.
The supper is done, and we shall arrive too tardy.
Henceforth, ye lovers!
Strike the drum.
Where be Potpan?
When only one or two men possess all the goodly graces, and e'en they be soiled, things are in a sorry state.
Remove the stools, the sideboards, and the plates.
Thou, good friend, doth save me a piece of marzipan, and if thou lov'st me, bid the porter admit Susan Grindstone and Nell.
Aye, young sir, I am prepared.
They do seek thee in the grand chamber.
We cannot be in two places at once, both hither and yon!
Hail, lads!
Haste thee for a moment, and let he who hath the longest life claim all.
Hail, good sirs.
Whichever of you doth act shy, I'll swear she hath corns.
Hail, good sirs.
I do swear, it must be thirty years.
It hath been longer, it hath been longer.
Lucentio's son is elder than that, sir.
He hath seen thirty summers.
Art thou truly going to inform me of that?
His son was but a stripling a mere two years hence.
I know not, sir.
Oh, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
Mine eyes were deceivers, forsooth, for I ne'er beheld true beauty until this eve.
I can discern by his voice that this gentleman is of the Montague kin.
Wherefore art thou behaving so wrathful?
Uncle, this fellow is a Montague, our foe.
Art thou young Romeo?
Behold, yon scoundrel Romeo, that's he.
Hark thee, gentle kinsman, be calm.
Leave him be.
He doth comport himself as a noble gentleman, and, in truth, hath a reputation throughout fair Verona as a virtuous and well-behaved youth.
I would not affront him in mine own abode for all the riches in this fair city.
Hark! Be still, and let thy tempestuous spirit findeth peace.
Pay him no heed.
I will not brook him.
Thou art but, uncle, we are being disrespected.
Proceed, proceed.
Thou art a saucy knave.
Is it sooth, truly?
I wot what I shall do.
Thou art set to contradict me, art thou?
I shall instruct thee a lesson.
Dost not saints and pilgrims possess lips as well?
Aye, pilgrim, they possess lips meant for prayer.
Hark, saint, let lips perform what hands do.
I prithee, grant my humble prayer, lest my faith doth turn to despair.
Saints do not shift, even as they do grant prayers.
Then stay thee still whilst I doth enact my prayer.
Now hath my transgression been lifted from my lips by thine.
Doth my lips now bear the guilt of the sin they didst receive from thine?
What sin doth escape from my lips?
Grant me my transgression once more.
Thou kissest as if thou hast studied the art.
Madam, thy mother doth desire speech with thee.
Who doth bear her mother?
I did nurse her daughter, whom thou wert just speaking with.
Hear me, the man who weds her shall be blessed with great riches.
Nay, good sirs, do not make ready to depart at this moment.
We have a small sweetmeat approaching.
Thou speak'st true.
The quarrel is betwixt our lords, and we who toil in their service.
It doth remain unchanged.
I shall be a cruel master unto them.
Behead them?
Thou meanest to sever their heads, take their maidenheads, whatsoever.
Take my remark in whatever sense thou pleasest.
The women thou dost violate are they who must "feel" it.
Everyone doth knoweth i am a fair piece of flesh.
Thou art fortunate to not be a mere fish.
Thou art pulling out thy tool anon.
I have drawn my naked sword.
Hither, nurse, come hither.
Pray, who is yon nobleman?
He is the son and heir of ancient Tiberio.
Who goeth out the door at this present moment?
Verily, that one, methinks, is young Petruchio.
I know not his name.
Hie thee to inquire.
What ho! What manner of thing is this?
What ho! What manner of thing is this?
The strangers are all departed.
But he hath to make his speeches of love to a woman who is supposed to be his foe.
And Juliet is as much in love as he, but she hath even less occasion to encounter her beloved.
But love doth lend them strength, and time doth grant them opportunity to meet, sweetening the perilous risk with exquisite delight.
May I depart whilst my heart doth tarry here?
I wager he hath slipped hence and retired to his chamber to rest.
He did run this way and did leap o'er yon orchard wall.
Hark! Summon him, Mercutio.
I'll call him forth as though I were summoning a ghost.
Romeo, hark!
Reveal thyself in the guise of a lament.
Speaketh one rhyme, and I shall be content. 
Just cry out, "Ah me! " Just say "love" and "dove." Say just one lovely word to my good friend.
If he doth hear thee, thou wilt provoke his wrath.
What I speak cannot stir his wrath.
The things I do speak are fair and honest.
His affection, being blind, doth dwell in darkness.
If love be blind, it cannot aim aright.
Now he shall sit beneath a shady tree.
There is no purpose in seeking him if he doth not wish to be discovered.
The east doth shine, and Juliet is the sun.
Virginity doth make her seem pale and sickly.
Release it from thy grasp.
Hark! Yonder comes my fair lady!
Oh, it is mine own true love.
Oh, would that she knew the depth of my affection for her.
She doth prate, yet speaketh naught.
What ho?
Her eyes doth speaketh a tale.
She doth not deign to speak with me.
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven Have taken leave for business, and do ask Her eyes to twinkle in their stead until Their return.
If her eyes were in the night's fair firmament, they would shine so bright through yonder space that birds would start their sweet singing, thinking her light was the day's fair light.
Behold how she doth lean her hand upon her cheek.
Oh, would that I were the glove upon that hand, so that I might touch that cheek.
Oh , mine eyes!
Pray, who art thou?
I do detest my name, sweet saint, for it is your foe.
Art thou not Romeo?
Art thou not a Montague?
Pray, tell me, how didst thou gain entrance hither?
And wherefore didst thou come?
If any of my kin doth find thee here, they shall slay thee for thy lineage.
Hence, thy kinsmen are no hindrance.
If they do espy thee, they shall commit thy murder.
Just cast thine eyes upon me with kindness, and their malice shall not pierce my armor.
I'd give aught to keep them from beholding thee in this place.
I would sooner they slay me than live without thy love.
Else, thou wouldst perceive me blushing o'er the words thou hast heard me speak this eve.
Dost thou love me?
I know thou wilt say "ay," and I'll trust thee.
What should I swear by, pray tell?
Swear not at all.
But if thou must needs swear, swear by thy wondrous self, which is the god I do adore like an idol, and then will I believe thee.
If my heart's dear love, prithee, do not swear.
Although thou bring'st me joy, I cannot take joy in this exchange of promises this night.
Our love, which doth resemble a bud in the summer's breath, mayhap shall bloom into a fair flower upon our next encounter.
I pray thou dost partake in the same sweet peace and rest that doth dwell within my heart.
Oh, dost thou mean to depart and leave me thus unfulfilled?
What satisfaction couldst thou possibly have this eve?
I did vow my love to thee ere thou didst entreat me.
Yet would I could retract that vow, so I might have it to bestow anew.
Wouldst thou retract thy words?
Wherefore wouldst thou do such, my dearest?
Only to be bounteous and bestow it upon thee once more.
But I doth wish for something I already possess.
My bounteousness to thee is as boundless as the ocean, and my affection is as profound.
Hark! I doth hear a clamor within.
Sweet Montague, be faithful.
Tarry here for a moment.
I shall return anon.
Oh , blessed, blessed night!
Methinks, for 'tis dark, I do fear this be but a dream, too sweet to be true.
Three words, sweet Romeo, and then 'tis truly good night.
Fear not for me.
Let us not transgress the law by provoking a quarrel.
Let them commence some action.
I'll scowl at them as they do pass , and let them take their pleasure in my countenance .
Thou meanest howsoever they doth dare.
I shall bite my thumb at them.
Hark, art thou biting thy thumb at us?
I do bite my thumb, sir.
Art thou biting thy thumb at us?
Art thou endeavoring to provoke a quarrel?
Dost thou seek to provoke a quarrel?
Nay, good sir.
Morrow I shall dispatch the messenger.
My soul doth depend on it, a thousand times good night.
Parting from thee is a thousandfold more bitter than being in thy presence.
Oh, would that I could make my soul doth call my name.
The sound of lovers calling each others names through the night is as sweet as silver.
Romeo, hark!
What ho, my little falcon?
At what hour on the morrow should I dispatch a messenger unto thee?
By the hour of nine.
I shall not falter.
From this moment until that seems like twenty winters.
I have forgot why I did summon thee again.
Let me tarry here until thou dost recall thy wits.
I'll forget that I have any dwelling but this place.
The morn is nigh.
He doth permit the bird to hop a little from his hand, and then doth he yank him back by a string.
I doth wish I were thy feathered friend.
My sweet, so doth my heart incline.
But I would slay thee with excessive caresses.
Good morrow, good morrow.
Parting is a sorrow so sweet that I shall bid thee good night until tonight turns into tomorrow.
I pray thee rest in peaceful slumber.
I doth wish I were slumber and tranquility, so that I may pass the night in thy company.
Now will I visit my holy father, to seek his aid and recount to him my fortune.
Darkness doth stumble out of the sun's path like a drunken knave.
Now, ere the sun doth rise and scorch the dew, I must gather in my basket noxious herbs and healing blooms.
The earth is the mother of nature and also the tomb of nature.
From the womb of the earth, doth spring forth diverse kinds of plants and creatures, and the earth doth bestow upon her offspring many excellent provisions for sustenance.
"Herbs, plants, and stones doth hold great potency."
There is nought on this earth so foul that it doth not lend the earth some rare virtue.
Virtue doth turn to vice when it is misus'd.
Within the small husk of this feeble bloom, doth lie both venom and potent remedy.
In all things, be they men or herbs, there doth exist two contrary elements, good and evil.
When wickedness doth reign, death doth swiftly consume the body like a malignant tumor.
Good morrow, father.
May the blessings of God be upon thee.
Who doth bid me good morrow so early in the morn?
Young sir, something is amiss if thou art rising from thy slumber so early.
Every elder hath his cares, and anxious men doth ne'er find rest, but youth should bear no burden in this world.
They should retire to their chambers betimes and take their rest in abundance.
Hence, the truth that thou art awake so early doth inform me that thou hast been troubled with some distress.
If that be not so, then this must be the truth: thou, Romeo, hast not slept this night.
Thy final conjecture is accurate.
I did partake in a rest more sweet than slumber.
What sayest thou of Rosaline, father?
'That is well, my lad.'
Where hast thou been?
I shall inform thee ere thou need'st inquire once more.
Thou hast the hallowed power to heal us both.
I bear no enmity, good sir, for my plea shall profit mine adversary.
