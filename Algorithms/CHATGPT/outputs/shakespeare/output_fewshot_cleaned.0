A cryptic confession only leads to a cryptic absolution.
Then know that I am in love with the beautiful daughter of wealthy Capulet.
My love for her is as strong as her love for me, and together we are united, except for what we must unite through marriage.
When and where and how we met, we courted and exchanged vows, I'll tell you as we walk, but I ask this: that you agree to marry us today.
Wow, Saint Francis, what a transformation has occurred!
Has Rosaline, whom you loved so dearly, been abandoned so quickly?
Young men's love is not genuine in their hearts, but rather in their eyes.
Your sighs still reach my ears as the sun has not yet cleared them from the heavens.
Look, there's a mark on your cheek from an old tear that hasn't been wiped away yet.
If you were ever true to yourself and these sorrows were truly yours, then you and these sorrows were all for Rosaline.
Are you different now?
Say this then: women may fail when men have no strength.
You often scold me for loving Rosaline.
For obsessing, not for loving, my student.
And you told me to bury love.
Not to bury one in a grave, but to have another one out.
Please, don't scold me.
The other person did not do that.
Oh, she knew that you were just going through the motions of love, unable to truly express it.
Come on, young wanderer, come with me. I'll help you in one way, because this marriage might just be the thing to turn your families' anger into love.
Let's get out of here.
I am in a rush.
Take your time and think carefully.
Those who run too quickly often stumble.
Where the hell could this Romeo be?
Did he not come home tonight?
Not to his father's liking.
I talked to his servant.
Why, that same cold-hearted girl, Rosaline, is tormenting him so much that he will surely go insane.
Tybalt, a relative of Old Capulet, has sent a letter to his father's house.
I swear it's a challenge.
Romeo will respond to it.
Any person who knows how to write can respond to a letter.
No, he will respond to the letter's owner, showing his courage by accepting the challenge.
Oh, poor Romeo!
and is he capable of facing Tybalt?
What's the matter with Tybalt?
What did you say?
Without his deer, he's as useless as a dried fish.
Oh flesh, flesh, you are so fish-like!
Now he is writing poetry in the style of Petrarch.
Good morning to both of you.
What fake did I give you?
"Oops, sir, you dropped something."
Can't you understand?
No, I am the epitome of politeness.
I serve a man just as good as you.
There is no improvement.
well, sir.
You're not telling the truth.
You don't know what you're doing.
What, are you mixed in with these heartless peasants?
Stay out of this, Benvolio.
I feel like I'm losing my mind.
Ride faster, or I'll call for a race.
No, if we continue to chase after foolish ideas, I am finished, because you have more foolishness in one of your thoughts than I am certain I have in all five of mine.
Did I join you for the goose?
You were never there for me for anything unless there was something in it for you.
I will give you a good nip on the ear for that joke.
No, dear goose, don't bite.
Your humor is both sweet and sour.
It's a really strong sauce.
And isn't it well deserved to be turned into a sweet goose?
Oh, here's a clever person, who can stretch the truth from a little to a lot!
I reach out for that word "broad," which, when added to the goose, shows that you are truly a foolish person.
Why, isn't this better than just moping around for love?
You're being friendly now.
You are now Romeo.
You would have otherwise made your story long.
Oh, you are mistaken.
I would have kept it brief, because I had reached the heart of my story and intended to not dwell on the topic any longer.
Here's some nice stuff.
Two, two, a shirt and a smock.
Hey, Peter!
Hurry up!
Peter, hand me my fan.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Hello, good evening, beautiful lady.
Is it good, even?
It's no less, I tell you, because the dirty hand of the clock is now at twelve o'clock.
Get out of here!
What kind of man are you?
One woman, whom God has created, to ruin herself.
By my word, that is well said.
"Who does he think he is to ruin his own life?" he said.
Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I can find the young Romeo?
I can tell you, but by the time you find young Romeo, he will have aged more than when you first looked for him.
I am the youngest of that name, simply because there is no one else.
You make a good point.
Is everything okay?
Very well done, I must say, very clever, very clever.
She will invite him to dinner.
"Hey there!"
What have you found?
Romeo, are you going to your father's house?
Let's go to dinner over there.
I will come after you.
A man, nurse, who loves the sound of his own voice, and will talk more in a minute than he will follow through on in a month.
If he says anything against me, I'll put him in his place, even if he were stronger than he is, and twenty others like him.
And if I can't do it, I'll find someone who can.
You dirty rascal!
I am not one of his flirty girls.
I am not one of his accomplices.
I didn't see anyone treating you however they pleased.
If I had it, I would have drawn my weapon out quickly, I guarantee it.
I'm not afraid to draw my sword as quickly as anyone else if I see a good reason for a fight and the law is on my side.
Now, by God, I am so upset that every part of me is shaking.
You dirty rascal!
Nurse, please give my regards to your lady and mistress.
I swear to you, my dear friend, and I promise, I will tell her the same thing.
Goodness, she will be a happy woman.
What do you want to tell her, nurse?
You're not paying attention to me.
And there she will be confessed and married at Friar Lawrence's cell.
and wait, good nurse.
Within the next hour, my man will be behind the abbey wall with you, bringing ropes that are as strong as a ladder, which will guide me to the peak of my happiness in the hidden night.
Goodbye.
Be trustworthy, and I'll reward your efforts.
Goodbye.
Give my regards to your mistress.
May God in heaven bless you now!
Listen, sir.
What do you say, my dear nurse?
Is your man keeping secrets?
Have you never heard the saying, "two can keep a secret, if one of them is dead"?
I assure you, my man is as loyal as can be.
Well, sir, my lady is the kindest woman. Oh my goodness!
When she was just a little talkative child, oh, there is a nobleman in town, named Paris, who would like to marry her, but she, good soul, would rather see a toad, any toad, than see him.
Sometimes I make her mad and tell her that Paris is the better man.
However, I guarantee you, when I say that, she looks as pale as any cloth in the entire world.
Don't you agree, nurse, what about that?
Ah, you joker, that's the dog's name.
Give my regards to your lady.
Yes, definitely, Peter!
Hurry up!
Before and quickly.
The clock struck nine when I sent the nurse.
Maybe she can't see him.
That is not true.
Oh, she walks with a limp!
The messengers of love should be thoughts, which move ten times faster than the sun's rays, pushing away darkness over gloomy hills.
The sun is now at the highest point of the day, and it's been three long hours since nine o'clock, but she still hasn't arrived.
If she had feelings and a young, passionate spirit, she would move as quickly as a ball.
I would exchange words with my sweet love, and he would do the same with me.
But old people often pretend to be dead, clumsy, slow, heavy, and as pale as lead.
Oh God, here she comes. Oh dear nurse, what news do you have?
Have you met with him?
Send your man away.
Peter, wait by the gate.
Now, dear nurse, oh my goodness, why do you look so sad?
Even though the news is sad, still deliver it cheerfully.
If you're happy, you're ruining the good news by delivering it with such a sour expression.
I am tired.
Allow me a moment.
Goodness, my bones are really hurting!
I wish you had my strength and I had your information.
Can't you stay for a little while?
Don't you see that I'm out of breath?
How are you out of breath when you have enough breath to tell me that you are out of breath?
Your excuse for being late is longer than the story you're excusing.
Is your news good or bad?
What is your response to that?
Say either, and I'll stop the situation.
Let me be content.
Is it good or bad?
Well, you have made a straightforward decision.
You don't know how to pick a man.
Romeo, come here!
No, not him, even though his face is better than any man's, his leg is better than all men's, and as for his hand, foot, and body, though they are not worth mentioning, they are unmatched.
He may not be the epitome of politeness, but I guarantee he is as gentle as a lamb.
Get out of here, girl.
Worship God.
Have you already eaten at home?
"No, no," she said firmly.
but I already knew all of this.
What does he think about our marriage?
What about that?
My back is hurting on the other side.
"Ouch, my back is killing me!"
Honestly, I'm sorry to hear that you're not feeling well.
Hey, nurse, tell me, what does my love say?
Your love speaks like a true gentleman, polite, kind, handsome, and I'm sure, virtuous. Where is your mother?
Where's my mom?
why, she is inside.
Where could she possibly be?
You're replying in a strange way!
Your love asks, like a decent man, "Where is your mother?"
Oh dear lady, are you so angry?
Come on, let's go, I believe.
Is this the remedy for my sore bones?
From now on, deliver your own messages.
Here's such a commotion.
What does Romeo say?
Do you have permission to go to confession today?
I have a desire to strike you before you speak.
Then go quickly to Friar Lawrence's cell.
There is a husband waiting to marry you.
Now your cheeks are blushing with desire.
They will be in red immediately upon hearing any news.
Go to the church.
I need to find another way to get a ladder, so that your love can climb up to a bird's nest when it gets dark.
Get going.
I'm going to dinner.
Go to the cell.
I'm just trying to maintain peace.
Sheath your sword, or use it to separate these men with me.
What, you want to fight and then talk about peace?
I despise the word, just as much as I despise hell, all Montagues, and you.
Come on, you coward!
Weapons, bills, and spears!
Hit!
Knock them out!
We're against the Capulets!
Let's bring down the Montagues!
What is that sound?
Give me my sword!
Old Montague has arrived and is waving his sword at me in defiance.
You villain Capulet!
You shall not move a single step to look for an enemy.
Make haste to seek out good luck!
Goodbye, honest nurse.
I agree, I agree.
No matter how much sorrow may come, it cannot compare to the joy I feel in just one short minute with her.
So, love in moderation.
Long-lasting love does that.
Arriving too quickly is just as bad as arriving too slowly.
The lady is approaching.
Oh, a foot so light will never wear down the everlasting flint.
Hello to my spiritual advisor.
Romeo will thank you, daughter, on behalf of both of us.
He should be grateful to me, otherwise his gratitude is excessive.
Oh Juliet, if your happiness matches mine, and you have the skill to express it better, then let your breath sweeten the air around us, and let music convey the joy we both feel in this meeting.
Conceit, with more substance than words, boasts of its content, not its decoration.
Come on, let's go and we'll get this done quickly.
I beg you, Mercutio, let's go inside.
You're just like those guys who walk into a bar, slam their sword on the table and say "I hope I don't need you!" Then after a few drinks, they pull it on the bartender when there's no real reason to.
Do I resemble that guy?
Come on, you're as hot-tempered as anyone in Italy, quick to get angry and quick to calm down.
And what's the plan?
No, if there were two of them, we would soon have none, because one would kill the other.
You, why, you will argue with a man who has a hair more or a hair less in his beard than you do.
You will pick a fight with a man for cracking nuts, for no other reason than that he has hazel eyes.
What kind of person would notice such a fight except for someone looking for trouble?
Your head is always full of arguments, just like an egg is full of meat, and yet your head has been beaten as senseless as an egg for all your fighting.
You got into a fight with a guy for coughing in the street because he woke up your dog that was sleeping in the sun.
Didn't you have a fight with a tailor for wearing his new jacket before Easter?
Is he really going to use old ribbon to tie his new shoes?
And still you try to teach me not to fight!
If I were as quick to argue as you are, anyone could easily buy my life for just a short amount of time.
What is the fee simple?
Oh, how simple!
Here come the Capulets, by my head.
I don't care at all.
Join it with something else.
Make it a word and a punch.
You'll find me ready for that, sir, if you give me a reason.
Can't you find a way to do something without receiving in return?
Mercutio, you hang out with Romeo.
What, are you trying to turn us into musicians?
If you turn us into minstrels, be prepared to hear nothing but discord.
We are speaking here in a public place.
Either go somewhere private and calmly discuss your complaints, or leave.
Here, everyone is looking at us.
Men's eyes were created to see and to let them stare.
I will not move for anyone's enjoyment, I.
Well, I hope you have peace, sir.
My man is approaching.
I swear, sir, he will never wear your uniform.
Tybalt, I have a good reason to love you, which excuses my anger at your greeting.
I am not a villain.
So, goodbye.
I see that you don't recognize me.
Boy, this won't make up for the harm you've caused me.
So turn around and get your weapon ready.
And so, Mr. Capulet, whose name I hold as dearly as my own, be content.
Oh, to submit in such a dishonorable and vile manner!
What do you want from me?
Will you pull your sword out of its sheath by the hilt?
Hurry up, or I'll be on top of you before you know it.
I am on your side.
Hey Mercutio, put away your sword.
Get out of here, Tybalt.
I am injured.
A curse on both your families!
I am done for.
Has he left and has nothing?
What, are you injured?
Well, that's sufficient.
Where is my servant? Go, you scoundrel, bring a doctor.
Take heart, my friend.
The injury can't be too severe.
No, it's not as deep as a well or as wide as a church door, but it's sufficient, it will do.
Ask for me tomorrow, and you'll find me a serious man.
I am sure I am well-seasoned for this world.
A curse on both your families!
Goodness, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat - all capable of scratching a man to death!
A braggart, a scoundrel, a villain who fights with calculated precision!
Why did you come between us, for heaven's sake?
You hurt me when you put your arm around me.
I thought everything was for the best.
Help me get into a house, Benvolio, or I will pass out.
A curse on both your families!
They have turned me into worm food.
I have it, and I have it securely as well.
Your homes!
Oh Romeo, Romeo, Mercutio is dead!
Here comes Tybalt, angry as ever.
Mercutio is dead, but I am still alive and victorious!
Either you or I, or both of us, must go with him.
You, miserable boy, who kept him company here, will go with him from here.
This will decide that.
Romeo, go away, leave!
The people are angry, and Tybalt is dead.
Don't be surprised.
The prince will sentence you to death if you are captured.
Get out of here, go away!
Why are you still here?
Where did the person who killed Mercutio go?
Where did that murderer Tybalt run off to?
There lies Tybalt.
Talk, nephew.
Were you there when it started?
Where are the despicable instigators of this fight?
"Dear prince, I can reveal all the unfortunate details of this deadly fight."
There lies the man, killed by young Romeo, who also killed your relative, the brave Mercutio.
Tybalt, my cousin! Hey!
Oh, my nephew!
Hey cousin, cousin!
Who started this violent fight, Benvolio?
Romeo shouts, "Wait, guys! Hold on!"
"Guys, split up!" And faster than his words, his quick arm knocks down their deadly weapons, and he rushes between them, under whose arm a jealous thrust from Tybalt ended the life of brave Mercutio, and then Tybalt ran away.
But soon after, Romeo, who had just decided to seek revenge, returns and they rush at each other like lightning. Before I could intervene, Tybalt was killed.
And as he fell, Romeo turned and ran away.
Tell the truth, or Benvolio will die.
He's not telling the truth.
About twenty of them fought in this dark conflict, and all of those twenty could only take one life.
I plead for justice, which you, prince, must provide.
Romeo killed Tybalt.
Romeo must not be allowed to live.
Romeo killed him; he killed Mercutio.
Who now owes the price of his own precious blood?
His mistake only ends with what the law should decide, Tybalt's life.
I am curious about what you are going to say.
But I'll punish you with such a heavy fine that you will all regret causing me harm.
I will not listen to any begging or excuses.
Neither crying nor begging will buy forgiveness for mistreatment, so don't bother trying.
Take away this body and follow our orders.
Showing mercy only leads to more killings.
Lovers can perform their romantic rituals by their own attractiveness, or, if love is blind, it is most suited for the night.
Come, peaceful night, you solemnly dressed woman, all in black, and teach me how to gracefully accept losing a game played for the innocence of two young women.
Cover my blushing face with your dark cloak, until this new love becomes bold and realizes that true love is simply being modest.
Come on, night.
Come on, Romeo.
Come, day in night, for you will lie on the wings of night whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
And when I die, take him and carve him into little stars, and he will make the night sky so beautiful that the whole world will fall in love with the night and ignore the bright sun.
What about the ropes that Romeo asked you to bring?
Yes, yes, the ropes.
Oh no, what's the news?
Why are you wringing your hands?
Alas, oh no!
We're finished, ma'am, we're finished!
Alas, the day!
Is it possible that heaven is so jealous?
Romeo can do it, even if heaven can't.
Who are you, and why are you tormenting me like this?
This torture should be screamed in a miserable hell.
Has Romeo killed himself?
Just say "yes," and that simple word is more deadly than the gaze of a cockatrice.
I am not myself if there is someone who can make you answer "yes" with their eyes closed. If he is killed, say "yes," or if not, say "no." Quick sounds will decide my fate.
Do not look at freedom, eyes, you are going to prison.
Despicable ground, return to the earth.
Oh Tybalt, Tybalt, you were the best friend I ever had!
I can't believe I lived to see you dead.
Has Romeo been killed, and is Tybalt also dead?
My beloved cousin and my even dearer lord?
Tybalt has left, and Romeo has been exiled.
Oh God, did Romeo kill Tybalt?
Yes, it did, it did.
Alas, it happened that day.
You have a deceitful heart hidden behind a beautiful face!
Has any dragon ever kept such a beautiful cave?
You're a contradiction, acting like a gentle lamb but with the heart of a fierce wolf!
Oh nature, why did you have to bring a demon into the moral paradise of such a sweet body?
Has there ever been a book with such disgusting content but presented so beautifully?
Where is my servant? Bring me some strong liquor. These troubles, these hardships, these sorrows are aging me.
Romeo should be ashamed!
May your tongue be cursed for making such a wish!
He was not meant to be disgraced.
Shame is too embarrassed to show on his face, because it's a place where honor should be celebrated.
I was such a fool to scold him, the only ruler of the entire world!
Will you speak positively about the person who killed your cousin?
Why did you kill my cousin, you villain?
My cousin, that villain, would have murdered my husband.
All of this is comforting.
Why am I crying then?
I really want to forget it, but oh, it keeps coming back to my memory, like sinful deeds haunting the minds of sinners.
Tybalt is gone, and Romeo is exiled.
The word "banished" has caused the deaths of ten thousand Tybalts.
Tybalt's death was already tragic, but it didn't stop there.
Or, if sorrow enjoys company and eagerly joins with other sorrows, why did she not follow when she said "Tybalt is dead," "your father," or "your mother," or even both, which would have caused modern lamentations?
But to say that word, "Romeo is banished," is to say that father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet, all killed, all dead.
"Romeo is exiled." There is no end, no limit, no measure, no boundary in the death of that word.
No words can express that sorrow.
Where are my father and mother, nurse?
Crying and mourning over Tybalt's body.
Are you going to join them?
I will take you there.
Do they wash his wounds with tears?
I will cry until I have no tears left, because Romeo has been banished.
Lift those ropes. Oh, foolish ropes, we are both deceived, because Romeo has been banished.
He intended for you to be a path to my bed, but I, a virgin, will die without ever being married.
I would rather die than let Romeo take my virginity!
Go to your room.
I'll go find Romeo to console you.
I know exactly where he is.
Listen, your Romeo will be here tonight.
I'll go to him.
He is hiding in Lawrence's cell.
Romeo, come out.
Step forward, you scared man.
Dad, what's the news?
My dear son is too familiar with such unpleasant company.
I have news about the prince's fate to tell you.
What else but a disaster is the prince's fate?
Oh, being exiled!
Please show mercy and just say "death," because being banished is even more terrifying than death.
Do not mention "banishment." You are now exiled from Verona.
Be patient, the world is vast and expansive.
There is no world outside of Verona's walls but purgatory, torture, and hell.
Therefore, being "banished" is like being banished from the world, and being exiled from the world is like death.
You call death "banishment," then you cut off my head with a golden axe and smile as you kill me.
Oh, what a deadly sin!
Oh, you ungrateful rudeness!
It's torture, not mercy.
More respect, more dignity, more love can be found in carrion flies than in Romeo.
Flies may be able to do this, but I must escape from this situation.
They have their freedom, but I am exiled.
And do you still say that being exiled is not like death?
Did you not have any poison mixed, no sharp knife, no sudden way to kill me, even if it was a lowly way, but "banished" to kill me? "Banished"!
Hey friar, people in hell use that word.
The howling accompanies it.
How can you, as a holy man, a spiritual advisor, a forgiver of sins, and my professed friend, have the heart to hurt me with the word "banished"?
Listen to me for a moment, you foolish madman.
Before I arrived, the servants of your enemy and yours were engaged in close combat.
I stepped in to separate them.
As we exchanged attacks, more and more people joined the fight until the prince arrived and separated the two sides.
Where is Romeo?
Did you see him today?
I'm so relieved he wasn't involved in this fight.
I was heading towards him, but he noticed me and quietly slipped into the cover of the woods.
He has been seen there many mornings, crying and making the morning dew even heavier with his deep sighs.
but as soon as the sun starts to rise in the east and light begins to fill the sky, my lazy son sneaks back home.
Oh, you will bring up banishment again.
Stop talking.
Oh, then I realize that crazy people don't listen.
How can they know, when even wise men have no insight?
Let's talk about your situation.
You can't talk about something you don't feel.
If you were as young as I am, Juliet, and had just been married for an hour before Tybalt was killed, and were in love like me, and banished like me, then you could speak, then you could tear your hair and fall to the ground, as I am doing now, feeling the weight of an early grave.
Get up.
Someone is knocking at the door.
Hey Romeo, you better hide.
I won't do it, unless the sound of heartbroken sighs, like a mist, hides me from being seen.
Who is knocking so loudly?
Where do you come from?
What do you want?
O holy friar, please tell me, where is my lady's husband?
Where is Romeo?
Oh, he is just like my mistress, in her situation.
Oh, what a sad situation, such a pitiful predicament!
She lies there, crying and sobbing, sobbing and crying.
Stand up, if you're a man.
For Juliet's sake, please stand up.
Why would you let yourself fall into such a deep despair?
Hey, nurse!
Oh man, oh man.
Death is the ultimate end for everyone.
Did you speak of Juliet?
How is she doing?
Where is she?
And how is she doing?
What does my hidden lady say about our ended love?
It's as if that name, fired like a bullet, killed her, just like that name's cursed hand killed her relative.
Oh, tell me, friar, tell me, in what wretched part of this body does my name reside?
Tell me so that I can destroy the detestable house.
Are you a man?
Your wild behavior shows the irrational rage of an animal.
You have truly surprised me.
By my sacred oath, I thought your attitude was more balanced.
Have you killed Tybalt?
Why do you complain about your birth, the heavens, and the earth?
Shame on you, you disgrace your appearance, your love, your intelligence, which, like a greedy moneylender, have everything but use none of it in the way that would truly enhance your appearance, your love, your intelligence.
Hey, wake up, man!
Your Juliet is alive, for whom you were recently thought to be dead, and now you are happy.
Tybalt wanted to kill you, but you killed Tybalt, so you should be happy.
The law that once threatened death now becomes your ally, turning it into exile, and there you will find happiness.
may you be blessed with good fortune, and may happiness always be by your side.
But, you act like a spoiled and sulky girl, pouting about your luck and your love.
Go, go to your love, as it was commanded.
Go up to her room and comfort her.
Give my regards to your lady, and tell her to hurry everyone in the house to bed, as their heavy sorrow makes them ready for sleep.
Romeo is on his way.
Oh lord, I could have stayed here all night just to hear some good advice.
Wow, learning is amazing!
Go ahead and tell my sweetheart to get ready to scold.
Here, sir, she asked me to give you this ring, sir.
Hurry up, move quickly, it's getting very late.
I feel so much better because of this!
Get out of here.
Have a good night.
And here is where you stand: either leave before the guards arrive, or disguise yourself and leave before daybreak.
Stay in Mantua.
I'll locate your man, and he will inform you regularly of any good fortune that occurs here.
Give me your hand.
It's getting late.
Goodbye.
Unfortunately, sir, things have gone so badly that we haven't had time to relocate our daughter.
Look, she loved her cousin Tybalt very much, and so did I.
Well, we are destined to perish.
These troubled times leave no room for romance.
Goodnight, ma'am.
Give my regards to your daughter.
I'll do it, and I'll find out what she's thinking tomorrow morning.
Tonight she is confined to her sadness.
Sir Paris, I will do everything I can to win my child's love.
Let her know that my son Paris loves her, and tell her, listen to me, to be ready for the wedding next Wednesday. But wait!
What day is it today?
Monday, my lord.
Monday!
haha
Do you approve of this rush?
We won't make a big fuss, just a friend or two.
Listen, if Tybalt was just killed, people might think we didn't care about him, since he's our relative, if we party too much.
So we'll invite about six friends, and that's it.
What do you think about Thursday?
My lord, I wish it were Thursday tomorrow.
Go away now.
Alright, Thursday it is. Before you go to bed, go see Juliet.
Will you leave?
It's not even close to morning yet.
It was the nightingale, not the lark, that pierced your fearful ear.
Look, my love, see how the jealous streaks of light are weaving through the separating clouds in the eastern sky.
The night's candles have burned out, and the cheerful day is standing on the misty mountain tops.
That light over there is not daylight, I know it.
It's like the sun is sending a shooting star to guide you to Mantua tonight.
So, please stay a little longer.
You don't need to leave.
Take me away.
Put me to death.
I am happy if you are happy.
I am more inclined to stay than to leave.
come, death, and be embraced!
Let's have a conversation.
It's not daytime.
It is what it is.
It's the lark singing so off-key, making unpleasant and jarring sounds.
Some people say the lark sings beautifully.
This doesn't happen, because she is coming between us.
It's getting brighter and brighter.
Our troubles are getting darker and darker, while our hope is fading away.
Madam, I beseech you.
What is it, nurse?
Your mother is on her way to your room.
The day has dawned.
Then, window, open up and let the day in and let life out.
Goodbye, goodbye.
Give me a kiss, and then I'll come down.
He isolates himself in his room, closes the windows, blocks out the sunlight, and creates his own darkness.
My dear uncle, do you know the reason?
I don't know it and I can't learn it from him.
Have you tried to persuade him in any way?
I wish you were so pleased to stay and hear the truth. Come on, let's go, madam.
Have you left already, my love, my lord?
Oh, by the time I see my Romeo again, I will be much older.
Goodbye!
I will not miss any chance to send my love and greetings to you.
Do you think we will ever see each other again?
Oh god, I have a bad feeling.
I think I see you now, you are as low as a dead person at the bottom of a tomb.
Either my eyes are deceiving me, or you look pale.
And believe me, my love, you can see it in my eyes too.
Our blood is drained by constant sorrow.
Goodbye, goodbye!
Oh luck, luck!
Everyone calls you unreliable.
Be unpredictable, luck, because then, I hope, you won't keep him for long, but send him back.
Who's calling?
Is that my mother, lady?
What brings her here unexpectedly?
What's up, Juliet?
Madam, I am not feeling well.
Are you still crying for your cousin's death?
What, are you going to wash him from his grave with tears?
If you could, you still couldn't make him live.
So, stop it already.
Some sadness can indicate a lot of love, but too much sadness still shows a lack of wisdom.
But let me cry for such a heartbreaking loss.
So you will feel the absence, but not the friend that you mourn for.
Feeling the loss so deeply, I can't help but cry for my friend all the time.
Well, girl, you're not crying so much for his death, but because the villain who killed him is still alive.
Who is the villain, ma'am?
That same scoundrel, Romeo.
The reason is that the treacherous killer is still alive.
Yes, madam, out of the reach of my hands.
I wish only I could avenge my cousin's death!
Then don't cry anymore.
I'll send someone to Mantua, where that banished troublemaker lives, to give him a potion that will make him join Tybalt soon.
And then, I hope, you will be content.
I will never be content with Romeo until I see him dead, my heart is troubled for a relative.
Madam, if you could just find someone to carry out a poison, I would dilute it so that Romeo could peacefully fall asleep after taking it.
To avenge the love I had for my cousin on the body of the one who killed him!
Find a way, and I'll find the right man.
But now I'll tell you good news, girl.
And happiness is much needed in such a difficult time.
What are they, if you please, your ladyship?
Well, well, you have a cautious father, my child.
Madam, what day is it today?
My dear, on Thursday morning, the noble gentleman, Count Paris, will marry you at Saint Peter's Church and make you a joyful bride.
Now, I swear by Saint Peter's church and by Peter himself, he will not make me a happy bride there.
I'm surprised at how quickly I have to get married before the man who should be my husband even starts to court me.
Please tell my father, sir, that I am not ready to get married yet, madam.
And when I do, I swear it will be Romeo, whom you know I despise, rather than Paris.
These are truly surprising news!
Your father is approaching.
Tell him yourself and see how he reacts to it.
What's up?
What do you mean, a water pipe, girl?
Why are you still crying, constantly shedding tears?
Have you given her the message we sent?
I wish the fool would be married to her grave!
How come, will she refuse?
Isn't she arrogant?
Doesn't she realize how lucky she is, even though she doesn't deserve it, that we have found such a worthy man to be her husband?
You're not proud of what you have, but grateful for what you have.
In what way, in what way, in what way, in what way?
This doesn't make any sense!
What is this?
"Thank you, but I'm not proud," and "I thank you, but I'm not proud," and yet, "not proud"?
Get out of here, you sickly, disgusting thing!
Get out, you worthless woman!
You greasy-faced fool!
Shame, shame!
What, are you crazy?
Dear father, I beg you to listen to me patiently as I speak just a word while on my knees.
Do not speak.
Do not respond.
Don't respond to me.
She's out there, coward!
May God in heaven bless her!
It's your fault, my lord, for treating her that way.
Why, my lady wisdom?
Get out of here with your gossip.
I am not speaking treason.
Oh, God, good evening.
Can't I speak?
Quiet down, you mumbling idiot!
Speak seriously at a party, because we don't need it here.
You are too angry.
Oh my goodness!
It drives me crazy.
Throughout the day and night, whether alone or in company, my constant concern has been to find a suitable match for her.
Thursday is approaching.
Place your hand on your heart and give me your honest advice.
If you agree to be with me, I'll introduce you to my friend.
Trust it, think about it.
I will not break my promise.
Postpone this wedding for a month, or even just a week.
or, if you don't want to, we can make the wedding bed in the dark tomb where Tybalt is buried.
Don't talk to me, because I won't say a word.
You do whatever you want, because I am finished with you.
Oh God! Oh nurse, how can we stop this from happening?
My husband is here on earth, but my faith is in heaven.
How can that faith come back to earth unless my husband sends it to me from heaven by leaving earth?
Cheer me up.
Don't you have anything happy to say?
Give me some comfort, nurse.
Oh, he's a charming man.
Romeo is nothing compared to him.
Madam, Paris has eyes that are as green, quick, and fair as an eagle's.
Curse my heart, I believe you are content with this second marriage, as it surpasses your first.
If it didn't, your first husband is dead, or it would be just as good if he were, since you have no use for him.
Do you speak from your heart?
So be it!
What did you say?
Well, you have comforted me greatly.
Go inside and tell my lady that I have left because I have angered my father, and I am going to Lawrence's cell to confess and seek forgiveness.
"Sure, I will, and this is a smart decision."
You are such a wicked demon!
I'll go to the friar to find out his solution.
If everything else fails, I have the power to die.
Is Thursday good for you, sir?
We don't have much time.
You claim to be unaware of the lady's thoughts.
I don't like it.
Do you now understand why we are in such a hurry?
Look, sir, the lady is coming towards my cell.
Nice to see you, my lady and my wife.
Perhaps, sir, that could happen when I become a wife.
Hey, good morning, cousin.
Is it still early in the day?
but it's just nine o'clock.
Did my father just leave in such a hurry?
It was a sight to behold.
Not having what they desire makes them feel incomplete, even though they already have it.
Are you in love?
Out with it.
What about love?
Where should we eat? Oh dear!
That "may be" must happen, love, on Thursday next.
What will be, will be.
That's a specific message.
Are you here to confess to this father?
To be honest with you, I should confess.
Don't refuse to admit to him that you love me.
I'll admit to you that I love him.
I'm confident that you love me, don't you?
If I do that, it will be more valuable if it's said behind your back than to your face.
Poor soul, your face is soiled with tears.
Your face belongs to me, and you have spoken ill of it.
My free time is available to me now, thoughtful daughter. My lord, we must ask for some time alone.
May God forbid that I should interrupt your prayers! Juliet, I will wake you up early on Thursday.
Juliet, I already understand your sorrow.
I hear that you must, and nothing can delay it, be married to this county next Thursday.
Don't tell me, friar, that you've heard about this, unless you tell me how I can stop it.
If you can't help me with your wisdom, just acknowledge that my decision is wise, and I'll take care of it with this knife right now.
Wait a moment.
Tomorrow is Wednesday.
Tomorrow night make sure you sleep alone.
Do not let the nurse sleep in your room with you.
No warmth, no breath will prove that you are alive.
Hand it over, give it to me!
Love gives me the strength, and that strength will help me afford it.
Goodbye, beloved father.
You won't have any trouble, sir, because I'll see if they can clean their fingers.
How can you treat them like that?
So anyone who can't adapt and make the best of a situation won't be coming with me.
Get out of here.
We will be very unprepared for this time.
Yes, indeed.
Look, here she comes from confession with a cheerful expression.
I have learned to regret my disobedience to you and your commands, and I am now required by holy lawrence to kneel here and ask for your forgiveness.
Summon the sheriff.
Go and inform him about this.
I'll have this problem solved by tomorrow morning.
I met the young lord at Lawrence's cell and showed him as much love as was appropriate, without crossing the line of modesty.
I'm happy about it.
This is good.
Get up.
"Okay, go and bring him here. Now, before God, this holy friar is really something!"
Our entire city owes him a great deal.
Nurse, will you come with me to my room to help me pick out the necessary accessories for my outfit tomorrow?
No, not until Thursday.
There is plenty of time.
We will go to the church tomorrow.
It's almost nighttime now.
Psh, I'll get moving and everything will be fine, I promise you, wife.
Go to Juliet and help her get ready.
I will not go to bed tonight.
Leave me alone.
I'll play the role of the housewife just this once.
Yes, those outfits are the best.
What, are you busy, hey?
Do you need my assistance?
Because I am certain that you have a lot on your plate with this unexpected situation.
Have a good night.
Goodbye! Who knows when we will see each other again.
I have to go through this sad situation by myself.
come here, vial.
What if this combination doesn't work?
Am I getting married tomorrow morning?
Lie down there.
Wow, look!
I think I see my cousin's ghost looking for Romeo, who was killed by a sword.
Don't go, Tybalt, don't go!
Romeo, Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou, Romeo?
Here's a drink for you.
I raise my glass to you.
No, cousin, I would rather cry.
What's on your mind, my friend?
why, that's just how love goes wrong.
What else could it be?
A clever insanity, a suffocating bitterness, and a preserving sweetness.
Goodbye, my cousin.
Be quiet!
I will go with you.
If you leave me like this, you are treating me unfairly.
Man, I am completely lost.
I am not present.
Tell me sadly, who do you love?
What, am I supposed to moan and confide in you?
"Ugh!"
Certainly not.
but unfortunately, tell me who.
Stop, take these keys, and bring more spices, nurse.
They are asking for dates and quinces in the pastry.
Hurry up, let's move, move, move!
The second rooster has crowed.
The curfew bell has sounded.
Do not hesitate to spend money.
Get out of here, you lazy woman. Go.
Go to bed, seriously.
You will feel unwell tomorrow from staying up all night tonight.
I have stayed up all night for less important reasons before, and never gotten sick.
"Sure, you've been a sneaky little mouse in the past, but I'll be keeping an eye on you from now on."
A suspicious hood, a suspicious hood!
Hey, buddy, what's up?
Hurry up, hurry up, buddy.
I have a clever mind, sir, that can figure things out on its own and never bother Peter for help.
Great job, and well said.
What a jolly bastard, ha!
You're going to be a fool. Honestly, it's daytime.
Woman!
Hey, are you there?
Hey, nurse, listen to what I'm saying!
Go wake up Juliet.
Go and tidy her up.
I will go talk to Paris.
Hurry up, move quickly.
The groom has already arrived.
Hurry up, I say.
Madam!
What, ma'am!
Juliet! Hurry, I bet it's her. Oh, sweetheart!
Wow, lady!
Well, my dear, I say.
Madam, listen!
My love!
Well, bride!
What, are you not going to say anything?
You're getting your money's worth now.
How deeply she sleeps!
Sure, let the county find you in your bed.
He will scare you, I swear.
Is it not going to happen?
What's all this noise?
What a terrible day!
What's wrong?
Hey, check this out.
Oh, what a terrible day!
Oh, woe is me!
My child, my everything, wake up, look at me, or I will die with you! Help, help!
Bring Juliet out, for shame.
Her husband has arrived.
She's gone, passed away, she's gone.
Oh no, what a day!
Alas, the day.
She's gone, she's gone, she's gone!
What did you say?
Show her to me.
out, oh no!
She is chilly.
Her blood has calmed, and her joints are rigid.
My life and these lips have been apart for a long time.
She looks like death has come too soon, like a frost on the most beautiful flower in the field.
What a terrible day!
Oh, what a sad time.
Death has taken her away, causing me to grieve, and now I am unable to speak.
Is the bride ready to go to the church yet?
Prepared to leave, but never to come back.
Death is married to my daughter.
Death will inherit everything from me.
He has married my daughter.
I will die and leave everything to him.
Life, existence, everything is controlled by death.
I've been waiting so long to see the morning, and is this really what I get to see?
Cursed, miserable, wretched, detestable day!
The most wretched hour that time has ever seen in the enduring toil of his journey.
But just one, only one, one poor and loving child, just one thing to bring me joy and comfort, and cruel death has taken it away from me!
Oh no!
Oh, what a terrible, terrible, terrible day!
This day has never been so dark.
Oh what a terrible day, oh what a terrible day!
Deceived, separated, mistreated, offended, killed!
You despicable death, deceived by you, cruelly, cruelly defeated by you!
Oh love!
oh, life!
It's not about life, but about love in death.
Despised, troubled, loathed, sacrificed, murdered!
Uncomfortable time, why did you have to come and ruin our celebration?
My soul, not my offspring!
You are dead!
Quiet down, stop it!
The solution to confusion does not lie within these chaotic circumstances.
Heaven and you both had a hand in creating this beautiful girl.
now everything belongs to heaven.
And it's even better for the girl.
You couldn't save her from death, but heaven will ensure her eternal life.
You only wanted her to be promoted, because it was your dream for her to succeed.
And are you crying now, seeing that she has risen above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
Oh, in this love, you treat your child so poorly that you are going crazy, even though she is doing well.
A woman is not well off if she stays married for a long time, but she is better off if she dies young and married.
Our music has turned from joyful wedding bells to mournful funeral tolls, and our celebration has become a somber burial gathering.
Our joyful songs turn into sad funeral songs, our wedding flowers are used for a buried body, and everything changes to the opposite.
Everyone get ready to follow this beautiful body to her grave.
The skies are frowning at you for some wrongdoing. Don't provoke them any further by defying their authority.
Sure, let's stop playing our instruments and leave.
Yes, indeed, the situation can be improved.
We are not fools.
It's not the time for playing now.
So you won't do it then?
I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st.
I will then give it to you thoroughly.
What are you going to offer us?
I swear, I have no money, only the gleek.
I will give you the musician.
Then I will give you the servant.
Then I will lay the servant's dagger on your head.
I will not entertain any whims or fancies.
Then I'll challenge you with my intelligence.
Now answer me like adults.
"Indeed, sir, silver does have a pleasant sound."
What do you think, James Soundpost?
Honestly, I don't know what to say.
I will speak on your behalf.
It's "music with its beautiful sound" because musicians don't have gold to make noise.
What a troublesome rascal this guy is!
String him up, Jack!
If I can believe the comforting truth of sleep, my dreams predict some happy news coming soon.
Oh, woe is me!
Love is so sweet when you have it, even just the thought of love brings so much happiness!
What's the news from Verona, Balthasar?
Don't you have any letters from the friar for me?
How is my lady doing?
How is my father doing?
How is Juliet doing?
I ask again, because everything will be fine if she is well.
Then she is fine, and nothing can be wrong.
Her body rests in Capulet's tomb, while her eternal soul resides with the angels.
I saw her buried in her family's tomb and immediately rushed to tell you.
Oh, forgive me for delivering this bad news, since you entrusted me with this task, sir.
A sick man, in his sadness, is writing his will, speaking harshly to someone who is also unwell.
I'm sad to say, cousin, I am in love with a woman.
What a skilled marksman!
She's beautiful and I love her.
A beautiful target, my dear cousin, is easiest to hit.
Well, in that swing you miss.
She hoards her beauty, and in doing so, she wastes it. By being so strict with her beauty, she prevents it from being passed down to future generations.
She is too beautiful, too intelligent, and too fairly wise to deserve happiness by causing me to feel hopeless.
Let me make the decisions.
Don't forget to think about her.
Oh, show me how to stop thinking!
Is it really so?
I challenge you, fate!
You know where I live.
Fetch me some ink and paper, and arrange for fast horses.
I will leave tonight.
I beg of you, sir, please be patient.
You look pale and troubled, and it seems like something bad has happened.
Psh, you're mistaken.
Go away and do what I told you to do.
Do you have any letters for me from the friar?
No, my lord, I cannot do that.
It doesn't matter.
Go away and rent those horses.
I'll be with you right away.
Well, Juliet, I will sleep with you tonight.
Let's find out what it means.
Oh mischief, you quickly enter the minds of desperate men!
I think this is the house, if I remember correctly.
It's a holiday, so the beggar's store is closed.
Hey there!
Pharmacist!
Who is shouting so loudly?
Come here, man.
I can tell that you are not wealthy.
Stop, there are forty ducats.
Are you so destitute and full of misery, and afraid to die?
You look like you're starving.
Your eyes show signs of hunger and suffering.
The world is not on your side, and neither are the world's rules.
The world doesn't provide any rules to make you wealthy.
Go buy some food and fatten yourself up. Come, be a comfort and not a poison, come with me to Juliet's grave, for I must use you there.
Hey, holy Franciscan friar!
Hey, brother!
This should be the same voice as Friar John's.
Welcome from Mantua!
What does Romeo say?
Alternatively, if he has written down his thoughts, then give me his letter.
So my journey to Mantua was delayed.
Who delivered my letter to Romeo?
Unfortunate luck!
Brother, I'll go and bring it to you.
Now I have to go to the tomb by myself.
Within the next three hours, Juliet will wake up.
I will send another letter to Mantua and keep her in my cell until Romeo comes.
Poor soul, trapped in a tomb of death!
Pass me your torch, kid.
Go away and stay at a distance.
But extinguish it, for I do not want to be seen.
Hand over those flowers to me.
Do as I tell you, go.
Yet I will take the risk.
The boy is warning that something is approaching.
What cursed person is coming this way tonight to disrupt my funeral and the true love's ceremony?
What's with the torch?
Wrap me up, night, for a little while.
Hand over that pickaxe and crowbar.
I'll be leaving, sir, and won't bother you anymore.
So you will demonstrate friendship to me.
Receive this.
Hey, young man, don't provoke someone who's desperate.
Get out of here and leave me alone.
Consider these past events.
Let them scare you.
I beg you, young man, do not make me even angrier by pushing me to sin again.
Get out of here!
Don't stay, leave.
Live, and in the future, say that a madman's mercy told you to run away.
I reject your threat and consider you a criminal here.
Are you trying to provoke me?
Then I'm coming for you, kid!
Oh my god, they're fighting!
I'm going to go call the police.
Please open the tomb.
Mercutio's relative, the honorable Count Paris.
What did my man say when I wasn't paying attention as we rode?
I believe he said that Paris was supposed to marry Juliet.
Did he not say that?
Did I just imagine it?
I will bury you in a glorious grave.
Is there a burial site?
Oh no.
A lantern, killed young man, because Juliet is lying here, and her beauty fills this tomb with a bright presence.
Death, which has taken your last breath, has not yet affected your beauty.
You have not been defeated.
Oh, what more kindness can I show you than to use the same hand that separated your youth in half to also separate his who was your enemy?
Should I believe that death, a non-existent entity, is in love, and that the repulsive, thin monster keeps you here in the dark to be his lover?
I will stay here with the worms that serve as your chambermaids.
I will make this my permanent resting place and rid myself of the bad luck that has burdened me.
Eyes, take one last look.
Arms, give me one last hug.
Your drugs work fast.
And so, with a kiss, I meet my end.
These cheerful masks that kiss the foreheads of beautiful women, when they are black, remind us that they conceal the beauty.
May Saint Francis guide me!
How many times tonight have my old feet tripped over graves! Who's there?
Here's a friend, someone who knows you well.
May you be blessed!
Tell me, my friend, what torch is that over there that is shining its light on worthless things like worms and eyeless skulls?
As I see it, it's burning in the Capulet's tomb.
Who is there?
Romeo, wherefore art thou?
How long has he been there?
For a whole thirty minutes.
Let's go to the vault together.
I can't do it, sir.
stay here, then.
I will go by myself.
I am filled with fear.
I'm afraid something bad is going to happen.
While I was sleeping under this yew tree, I dreamt that my master was fighting with someone else and that he killed him.
Romeo! Oh no, what blood is this that stains the stone entrance of the tomb?
Oh, you are a comforting friar!
Where is my husband?
I remember exactly where I should be, and that's where I am.
Where is my Romeo?
I can hear some noise.
Woman, get out of that place of death, disease, and unnatural slumber.
A force stronger than us has hindered our plans.
Let's go, let's get out of here.
Your husband and Paris are both dead in your arms.
Come, I'll take you to a convent of nuns.
A cup, held in my true love's hand?
I can see that poison has been his untimely demise. Oh, you selfish person, you drank it all and left me with no antidote to help me afterwards?
I'm going to kiss your lips.
Maybe there is still some poison on them, that could kill me but also save me.
Yeah, what's all the commotion about?
then I'll be quick.
Oh happy dagger, this is where you belong.
Let me rust away and die there.
This is the location.
Over there, where the torch is burning.
The ground is covered in blood. Let's search around the churchyard.
What a sad sight!
The county is dead here, and Juliet is bleeding, warm and newly deceased, who has been lying here buried for two days. Go, tell the prince.
Let's go to the Capulets' house.
Lift up the Montagues.
Some others are looking.
Here comes Romeo's servant.
We discovered him in the cemetery.
Keep him safe until the prince arrives.
Here is a friar who shakes, sighs, and cries.
We took the pickaxe and shovel from him as he was leaving the churchyard.
A strong feeling of distrust.
Keep the friar as well.
What unfortunate event is happening so early that it's waking us up from our morning sleep?
What could possibly be causing such a commotion?
Oh, the people in the street are shouting "Romeo," some "Juliet," and some "Paris," and they all run towards our monument with loud cries.
Search, seek, and find out how this terrible murder happened.
Oh my god!
Hey wife, look at our daughter bleeding!
This dagger has missed its mark, for, behold, his house is empty at the back of Montague, and it has mistakenly pierced my daughter's heart.
Oh, woe is me!
This view of death is like a bell, warning me of my old age and impending grave.
Alas, my king, my wife has passed away tonight.
The sorrow of my son's banishment has taken her last breath.
What other troubles are plotting against me in my old age?
Look, and you will see.
Let's hold off on expressing our anger for now, until we can clarify these uncertainties and understand their origin, their source, their true lineage. Then I will take charge of your troubles and guide you even to the point of death.
In the meantime, hold off and let bad luck be controlled by patience. Bring forward the people who are suspected.
I may be the best, but I have the least power, and yet I am the most suspected of this terrible murder, because the circumstances are not in my favor.
And here I stand, ready to accuse and defend myself, both condemned and acquitted by my own actions.
Then tell me immediately what you know about this.
I'll keep it short, because I don't have much time to talk.
In the meantime, I wrote to Romeo, asking him to come here tonight to help take her from her fake grave, when the potion's effects wear off.
What can he possibly say about this?
Their love story ended with the news of her death.
Montague, come here!
Hey, Montague, give me your hand.
But now, my lord, what do you say to my request?
but repeating what I have already said.
My child is still unfamiliar with the world.
She has not seen the age of fourteen years.
Mothers younger than her are made happy.
And those who are made too soon are also ruined too quickly.
But court her, kind Paris, win her heart.
Tonight I am hosting my usual party and I have invited many of my favorite guests.
Out of the doomed loins of these two enemies, a pair of unlucky lovers end their lives, and their tragic deaths finally put an end to their parents' feud.
The tragic story of their doomed love and the ongoing feud between their families, which could only be resolved by their children's deaths, is now the focus of our play. If you listen closely, we will do our best to make up for any shortcomings in our performance.
The joy that young men feel when well-dressed April follows the slow winter.
Tonight at my house, you will experience the same joy among the fresh fennel buds.
Go, dude, walk around in beautiful Verona.
Whoever's names are written here, go and find them.
It is said that the shoemaker should stick to his yardstick, the tailor to his shoe form, the fisherman to his fishing rod, and the painter to his paintbrush.
I am tasked with finding the people whose names are written here, but I can never figure out who wrote these names.
Take on a new infection in your eye, and the toxic poison of the old one will fade away.
Your plantain leaf is perfect for that.
What for, I ask you?
Why Romeo, are you crazy?
I'm not crazy, but I'm more trapped than a madman, locked up in prison, deprived of food, beaten and tortured, and, good evening, my friend.
Good evening, God.
Excuse me, sir, can you read?
"Ah, my own luck in my suffering."
Maybe you've learned it without studying.
Can you please tell me if you can read anything you see?
Yes, if I understand the alphabet and the language.
You're speaking the truth.
Wait, buddy.
I am able to read.
Seigneur Martino and his family; County Anselme and his beautiful sisters; the widow of Vitruvio; Seigneur Placentio and his lovely nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; my uncle Capulet, his family; my beautiful niece Rosaline and Livia;
Seigneur Valentio and his cousin Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena. A beautiful gathering.
Where should they go?
Get up.
Where are you going?
Shall we go to dinner?
to our home.
Whose house is it?
My master's is in the house.
I should have asked you that earlier.
Now I'll tell you without you having to ask.
My boss is the wealthy Capulet, and if you're not from the Montague family, I invite you to come and have a drink with us.
Take care and be happy!
At the same old Capulet's party, the beautiful Rosaline, whom you love so much, dines with all the admired beauties of Verona.
Go there, and with an unbiased eye, compare her face with others that I will show you, and I will make you think your beautiful swan is actually an ugly crow.
Is there anyone more beautiful than my love?
The sun has never seen anyone like her since the beginning of the world.
I'll go with you, not to see anything special, but to enjoy the beauty of my own.
Nurse, where is my daughter?
Summon her to come to me.
Now, I told her to come when I was just twelve years old.
What's up, lamb!
Who's calling me now?
Thy mother.
Madam, I am present.
What do you want?
You know my daughter is at a beautiful age.
I swear, I can tell her exact age down to the hour.
She is not yet fourteen years old.
I'll bet fourteen of my teeth, and yet, to be honest, I only have four. She is not fourteen.
Whether it's even or odd, on any day of the year, she will be fourteen on Lammas Eve at night.
Susan and she, may all Christian souls rest in peace, were the same age.
Well, Susan is in heaven.
She was too much for me.
but, as I mentioned, on Lammas Eve at night she will be fourteen years old.
She will do that.
"Wow, I remember it clearly."
It's been eleven years since the earthquake, and she was weaned. I will never forget that day, out of all the days of the year.
Because I had put bitter feelings in my heart, sitting in the sun under the dovecote wall.
My lord and you were in Mantua at that time. No, I do remember. But, as I was saying, when it tasted the bitterness of wormwood on my nipple and reacted so angrily, it was quite foolish.
"Shake the dovehouse!" said the bird.
There was no need to tell me to leave, I think.
"Yeah," he said, "are you falling on your face?"
And, you silly fool, it stopped and said "yes." That's enough of this.
Please, be quiet.
Sure thing, ma'am.
But I can't help but laugh to think it would stop crying and say "yes." And yet, I bet it had a bump on its forehead as big as a young rooster's egg, a dangerous knock, and it cried bitterly.
"Yes," my husband said, "did you fall on your face?"
You will fall backwards when you come to old age.
Will you not, Juliet? "It stopped and said "yes." And you stop too, I beg you, nurse, say I.
May God bless you with his grace!
You were the most beautiful baby I ever cared for.
If I could live to see you married, my wish would come true.
Tell me, Juliet, are you open to getting married?
I never even dreamed of such an honor.
Well, consider getting married now.
There are girls younger than you in Verona who are already mothers, esteemed ladies.
According to my calculations, I was your mother at around the same age that you are now.
So, in short: brave Paris is looking for you because he loves you.
Hey man, young lady!
Verona's summer does not have a flower as beautiful as this.
What do you say?
I'll see if I end up liking what I see.
I won't gaze at you any more intensely than your approval allows.
I have to leave now to wait.
I beg you, please follow directly.
We're coming with you, Juliet. The county is waiting.
"Go, girl, find joyous nights to match your joyous days."
What, are we going to use this speech as our excuse?
Shall we continue without apologizing?
The date is taking too long.
But let them judge us by whatever standards they choose.
Pass me a flashlight.
I am not in favor of this leisurely stroll.
No, Romeo, we need you to dance.
I'm telling you, it's not me.
You have nimble-soled dancing shoes.
I feel so heavy-hearted that I am stuck to the ground and can't move.
You are in love.
Borrow Cupid's wings and fly above the ordinary limits.
I am too wounded by his arrows to fly with his light wings, and so constrained, I cannot rise above deep sorrow.
I feel weighed down by the burden of love.
I mean, if we get angry, we'll fight.
I hit fast when I'm provoked.
But you are not easily provoked to hit.
To move is to act, and to be brave is to remain steadfast.
A dog from that house won't make me stop.
And to drown in it, if you burden love, it's too much pressure for something delicate.
Is love a delicate emotion?
It's too harsh, too crude, too loud, and it stings like a thorn.
If love treats you roughly, then treat love roughly in return.
Let carefree people dance lightly on the floor with their heels.
Let's go, we're wasting time!
No, that's not true.
We waste our time in vain, like lights during the day.
We have good intentions in attending this party, but it's not wise to go.
Why, one might inquire?
I had a dream last night.
And I did too.
So, what did you have in mind?
Dreamers frequently deceive themselves.
They are in bed asleep, dreaming of things that are real.
Oh, I see now that you've been visited by Queen Mab.
Sometimes she runs over a courtier's nose, and then he dreams of sniffing out a lawsuit.
And sometimes she comes with a pig's tail tickling a priest's nose as he sleeps, then he dreams of getting another church position.
This is her, calm down, Mercutio, calm down!
The wind you're talking about is pushing us away from who we really are.
Dinner is finished, and we will be late.
Come on, strong men.
Hit the drum.
Where is Potpan? Why isn't he helping to clear away?
When good manners are only in the hands of one or two men, and they are unwashed too, it's a disgraceful thing.
Get rid of the chairs, clear out the cabinet, and make sure the dishes are taken care of.
Hey, do me a favor and save me a piece of marchpane, and, if you care about me, tell the porter to let Susan Grindstone and Nell in. Oh, and also Antony and Potpan!
"Okay, boy, get ready."
You are expected and requested to come to the main room.
We can't be in two places at once.
Cheer up, guys.
Hurry up for a bit, and let the one who lives longer have everything.
Hello, gentlemen!
The woman who is picky about her food, I'll bet, has calluses on her feet.
Have I approached you now? Welcome, gentlemen!
By my lady, it's been thirty years.
It's more, it's more.
His son is older, sir.
His son is thirty years old.
Can you tell me that?
His son was only a minor two years ago.
I don't know, sir.
Oh, she makes the torches burn brightly!
I never saw real beauty until tonight.
This guy sounds like a Montague. How dare this guy come here, hiding behind a mask, to mock and ridicule our celebration?
Why are you so angry?
Uncle, this guy is a Montague, our enemy, a jerk who has come here just to mock our party tonight.
Are you young Romeo?
It's him, that scoundrel Romeo.
Listen to me, dear cousin.
Leave him be.
He carries himself like a respectable man, and, to be honest, Verona boasts of him as a virtuous and well-behaved young man.
I wouldn't let anyone in my house disrespect him, no matter how much money they offered.
So just be patient.
Ignore him.
You won't tolerate him!
Why, uncle, it's disgraceful.
"Come on, let's go."
You are a cheeky kid.
Is that really true?
This trick might end up hurting you, I know it.
You must oppose me.
I'll make you be quiet. What's up, my friends!
Do saints not have lips, and holy pilgrims as well?
Hey, pilgrim, those lips are meant for praying.
Oh, then, beloved saint, let our lips do what our hands do.
They pray; please grant their request, or else their faith may turn into despair.
Saints do not move, even if you pray for their help.
Then don't move while I make my prayer come true.
So from my lips, by yours, my sin is cleansed.
then my lips are guilty of the sin they have committed.
What sinful words are coming from your lips?
Give me back my sin.
You're a smooth talker.
Madam, your mother wants to talk to you.
What is her mother like?
I took care of her daughter that you were speaking with.
I'm telling you, whoever can catch her will have the money.
No, gentlemen, don't get ready to leave.
We're having a small, silly party tonight. Is that right?
I'm going to bed.
The argument is between our bosses and us, their employees.
It doesn't matter.
I will make sure everyone sees me as a tyrant.
What about the maids' heads?
Yes, the heads of the maids, or their virginity.
Take it however you want to interpret it.
They must understand it from their own experience.
They will feel my wrath as long as I can stand, and everyone knows I am quite the catch.
It's a good thing you're not a fish.
Pull out your weapon!
I have drawn my sword.
Come here, nurse.
Who is that man over there?
The son and heir of the elderly Tiberio.
Who is that guy leaving the door now?
Well, I believe that is young Petruchio.
I don't know.
Go and find out his name, and also check if he is married.
What is this?
What is this?
All the strangers have left.
Now Romeo is in love and loved in return, both enchanted by each other's appearance. But he must complain to his enemy, and she must steal love from fearful obstacles.
And she loves him just as much, but she has much less opportunity to see her new love.
but passion gives them strength, time allows them to come together, balancing extremes with extreme sweetness.
Can I move forward when my heart is still here?
He is smart, and I swear he has already gone home to bed.
He ran in this direction and jumped over that orchard wall.
Hey, Mercutio, come here.
No, I'll cast a spell as well!
Romeo, come here!
Show yourself in the form of a sigh!
Just say one rhyme, and I'll be happy.
Just say "oh no!" and talk about love and doves. Say one nice thing to my friend Venus, a nickname for her blind son Cupid, who shot so accurately when King Cophetua loved the beggar girl. He doesn't hear, he doesn't move, he doesn't stir.
If he hears you, you will make him angry.
He can't be mad about this.
My request is sincere and truthful.
His love is blind and is most suited to the darkness.
If love is blind, it can't find its target.
Now he will sit under a medlar tree and wish his lover were that kind of fruit as maids call medlars when they laugh alone. Oh Romeo, if only she were!
Go ahead, it's pointless to look for him here if he doesn't want to be found.
Juliet is like the sun rising in the east.
Her virgin attire is only pale and sickly, and only fools wear it.
Throw it away!
She is my lady.
oh, it's my beloved.
Oh, if only she knew who she really is!
She talks, but she doesn't say anything.
What about that?
She speaks with her eyes.
She's not speaking to me.
Two of the most beautiful stars in the sky are asking her eyes to sparkle in their place while they are away on business.
Her gaze in the sky would shine so brightly that birds would sing and think it was not night.
Look at how she rests her cheek on her hand.
I wish I were a glove on that hand so I could touch that cheek!
Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo?
Why are you Romeo?
It's just your name that's my enemy.
From now on, I will never be Romeo.
Who are you, hiding in the darkness, and interrupting my conversation?
I don't know how to tell you my name.
Aren't you Romeo, and a Montague?
The orchard walls are tall and difficult to climb, and it could mean death for you, given who you are, if any of my relatives find you here.
So your relatives don't bother me at all.
If they catch sight of you, they will kill you.
Just be kind to me, and I can withstand their hostility.
I wouldn't want them to see you here for anything in the world.
I would rather die from their hatred than live without your love prolonging my life.
You know it's dark out, otherwise my cheeks would be red from what I said tonight.
Do you love me?
I know you will say "yes," and I will trust your word.
What can I swear by?
Do not use any profanity.
Or, if you prefer, swear by your own gracious self, which is the god of my worship, and I'll believe you.
If you truly love me, please don't make any promises.
Even though I am happy to see you, I am not happy about this agreement tonight.
This love that is just beginning to bloom may become a beautiful flower when we meet again in the summer.
May your heart find as much sweet rest and peace as mine does.
Oh, will you leave me feeling so unfulfilled?
What satisfaction can you have tonight?
The swapping of your faithful promise of love for mine.
I gave you my heart before you even asked for it, and yet I wish I could give it to you again.
Would you take it back?
Why do you seek love?
but to be honest, and tell you again.
And yet I only wish for the thing I already possess.
My generosity knows no limits, and my love is as deep as the ocean.
I can hear some noise inside.
Goodbye, my dear love. See you soon, dear nurse! Montague, be faithful.
Just wait a moment.
I will return.
Oh, what a wonderful night!
I'm scared that, being in the dark, all of this feels like a dream that's too good to be true.
Give me three words, Romeo, and then we can say goodnight.
Do not be afraid of me.
Let's make sure the law is on our side.
Let them start.
I'll scowl as I walk by, and let them interpret it however they want.
No, they will dare.
I'll flip them off, which is an insult to them, if they tolerate it.
Are you flipping us off, sir?
I'm flipping you off, sir.
Are you flipping us off, sir?
Are you looking for a fight, sir?
Do you want to fight, sir?
No, sir.
I will send it tomorrow.
May my soul prosper, good night a thousand times!
It's a thousand times worse to be without your light.
Imprisonment is suffocating, and I can't speak loudly, or else I would scream so loudly that it would shake the cave where the echo lives, and make her voice even more strained than mine, by repeating "my Romeo!" It's my soul that is calling out for my love.
Lovers' voices sound so sweet at night, like the most soothing music to those who listen!
Romeo, come here!
What are you talking about?
What time tomorrow should I send a message to you?
By nine o'clock.
I will not let you down.
It's twenty years until then.
I forgot why I called you back.
Let me wait here until you remember it.
And I will continue to stay, so that you will continue to forget, forgetting any other home except for this one.
It's almost morning.
And yet no more than a playful bird, that allows it to hop a little from his hand like a poor prisoner in his twisted chains, and then with a silk thread pulls it back again, so lovingly possessive of its freedom.
I wish I were your bird.
I would like that too.
Yet I would love you to death.
Have a good night, sleep well!
Saying goodbye is bittersweet, but I'll say good night until tomorrow.
May peaceful sleep rest upon your eyes and bring peace to your heart.
I wish I could just sleep and find some peace, it would be so sweet to finally rest.
So I will go to my friar's cell to seek his help and share my good fortune with him.
The morning sun peeks through the clouds, casting streaks of light and chasing away the darkness.
Before the sun rises and the day begins, I must fill this basket with poisonous plants and beautiful flowers to dry out the night's damp dew.
Nature's mother, the earth, is also her tomb.
And from her womb, we find children of various kinds sucking on her natural bosom, each excellent for different virtues, yet all unique in their own way.
Oh, the great power that lies in herbs, plants, stones, and their true properties is immense.
There is nothing so disgusting that exists on earth that doesn't also provide some special benefit to the earth.
Good intentions can turn bad when used improperly, and bad actions can sometimes be seen as noble.
Within the small bud of this flower, there is both poison and healing power.
Two opposing forces are always present, in both humans and nature, grace and wild instinct.
And when the bad is in control, death quickly destroys that person.
Good morning, father.
Bless you.
Who is speaking to me so sweetly and early in the morning?
Young son, it's not healthy to say good morning to your bed so early.
Every old man's eyes are filled with worry, and where worry resides, sleep will never come.
But where young people with unburdened minds lay down to rest, there peaceful sleep rules.
So, your early arrival assures me that you have been disturbed by something.
Or if not, then I am correct: our Romeo has not been in bed tonight.
That is indeed true.
I had a much sweeter rest.
What about Rosaline, my spiritual father?
That's my wonderful son.
Where have you been, then?
I'll tell you before you have to ask me again.
Both of our solutions are found within your assistance and in the holy medicine.
I don't hold any grudges, blessed man, because my prayers also help my enemy.
