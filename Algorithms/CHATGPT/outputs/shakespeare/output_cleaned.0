A vague confession only leads to a vague absolution.
Then you should know that I am in love with the beautiful daughter of the wealthy Capulet.
Just as I am devoted to her, she is devoted to me, and together we are united, except for what we must unite through marriage.
I'll tell you when, where, and how we met and fell in love, but please, I ask that you agree to marry us today.
Wow, Saint Francis, what a transformation!
Did you really just abandon Rosaline, whom you loved so much, so quickly?
Young men's love doesn't truly reside in their hearts, but in their eyes.
The sun hasn't even risen yet, and I can still hear your old sighs echoing in my ears.
Look, there's a mark on your cheek from an old tear that hasn't been washed away yet.
If you were ever true to yourself and these sorrows were yours, then you and these sorrows were all for Rosaline.
Have you changed?
Say this now: Women can fail when men are not strong.
You often scold me for loving Rosaline.
My dear student, you are infatuated, not in love.
You told me to bury love.
Not to bury one person until another is laid to rest.
Please don't scold me.
The other person did not do the same.
Oh, she knew that you were just going through the motions with your love, unable to truly feel it.
But come, young wanderer, come, go with me. I'll help you in one way, because this marriage might just be the thing to turn your families' hatred into love.
Oh, let's go from here.
I am in a hurry.
"Take your time and think carefully."
Those who run fast often stumble.
Where on earth could Romeo be?
Did he not come home tonight?
Not to his father's place.
I talked to his servant.
Why is that cold-hearted girl, Rosaline, tormenting him so much that he's going to go crazy?
Tybalt, a relative of Old Capulet, has sent a letter to his father's house.
I swear on my life, it's a challenge.
Romeo will respond to it.
Any man who can write is able to respond to a letter.
No, he will respond to the letter's owner, explaining how he has the audacity to be challenged.
Oh, poor Romeo!
Is he really going to fight Tybalt?
Why, who is Tybalt?
What is that?
Without his testicles, he's as useless as a dried-up fish.
Oh flesh, flesh, why do you look like fish now!
He is now into the poetry that Petrarch wrote.
Good morning to both of you.
What fake thing did I give you?
The mistake, sir, the mistake.
Can't you understand?
No, I am the epitome of politeness.
I am just as good a person as you.
There is no one better.
Well, sir.
You're lying.
You don't know what you're doing.
Why are you hanging out with these heartless peasants?
Good Benvolio, don't interfere with us.
I feel faint.
"Switch and spurs, switch and spurs, or I'll challenge you to a duel."
No, if we're chasing after wild ideas, I'm finished, because you have more wild ideas in one of your wits than I'm sure I have in all five of mine.
"Was I there with you for the goose?"
You were never there for me unless there was something in it for you.
I'm going to bite your ear for that joke.
No, don't bite, good goose.
Your sense of humor is quite bittersweet.
It's a really spicy sauce.
And isn't it well served as a delicious goose?
Oh, here's a clever person who can stretch the truth from a little to a lot!
I'm just saying that calling you "broad" along with "goose" makes you seem like a big, wide goose.
Isn't this better than pining for love?
You are now sociable.
You are Romeo now.
You would have otherwise made your story long.
Oh, you are mistaken.
I would have kept it brief, because I have already told you everything I intended to and I don't want to discuss it any further.
Here's some good stuff.
Two, two, a shirt and a smock.
Peter, come here!
"Wait a moment!"
Hey Peter, it's me, your fan.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Good evening, fair lady.
Is it good even?
It's no less, I'm telling you, because the clock's hand is now pointing to noon.
Shame on you!
You're such a man!
One woman, whom God has made to ruin herself.
I swear, that's well said.
"He said, 'Why would I ruin it for myself?'"
Excuse me, gentlemen, do any of you know where I can find the young Romeo?
I can tell you that by the time you find young Romeo, he will have aged since you first started looking for him.
I am the youngest in my family, simply because there wasn't anyone younger.
You speak the truth.
Yeah, is everything okay?
Well said, indeed, very wisely.
She will invite him to dinner.
Well, well!
What have you found?
Romeo, are you going to your father's house?
Let's go to dinner over there.
I will go with you.
A man, nurse, who loves the sound of his own voice and will talk more in a minute than he will listen in a month.
If he says anything against me, I'll put him in his place, even if he's stronger than he is now, and even if there were twenty more like him.
If I can't do it, I'll find someone who can.
You dirty rascal!
I am not one of his flirty girls.
I am not one of his accomplices.
I didn't see anyone using you for their own pleasure.
If I had it, I would have drawn my weapon quickly, I promise you.
I will fight just as quickly as anyone else if I have a good reason and the law is on my side.
Now, by God, I am so upset that every part of me is shaking.
You dirty rascal!
Nurse, please give my regards to your lady and mistress.
I swear to you, my friend, and I promise, I will tell her the same thing.
Oh my goodness, she's going to be a happy woman.
What do you want to tell her, nurse?
You don't pay attention to me.
She will go to Friar Lawrence's cell to confess and get married.
"Stay here, good nurse."
Within the next hour, my man will be behind the abbey wall with you, bringing ropes that are as sturdy as a ladder. These ropes will be my way to reach the peak of my happiness in the dark of night.
Goodbye.
Be reliable, and I will relieve you of your troubles.
Goodbye.
Give my regards to your mistress.
May God in heaven bless you now!
Listen, sir.
What do you say, my dear nurse?
Is your man keeping secrets?
Have you never heard the saying, "two can keep a secret, if one of them is dead"?
I assure you, my man is as loyal as can be.
Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Oh my goodness!
When she was just a little talkative thing, oh, there is a nobleman in town, named Paris, who would like to marry her, but she, bless her heart, would rather see a toad, a very toad, than see him.
I sometimes make her angry by telling her that Paris is the better man.
I guarantee you, when I say so, she looks as pale as a sheet in the entire world.
"Nurse, don't you say that. What's the matter with that?"
"Both of them are mocking me, that's the dog's name."
Give my regards to your lady.
Oh, definitely, Peter!
"Wait a moment!"
Before and quickly.
I sent the nurse when the clock struck nine.
Maybe she can't meet him.
That is not true.
Oh, she is disabled!
Thoughts should be the messengers of love, moving ten times faster than the sun's rays, chasing away darkness from gloomy hills.
The sun is now on the highest hill of today's journey, and it's been three long hours from nine to twelve, but she still hasn't arrived.
If she had feelings and a warm, youthful spirit, she would move as quickly as a ball.
I would exchange words with her about my sweet love, and he would do the same with me.
However, many elderly people pretend to be dead, clumsy, slow, heavy, and pale as lead.
Oh God, here she comes. Oh dear nurse, what's the news?
Have you met with him?
Send your man away.
Peter, remain at the gate. 
Hey, dear nurse, why do you look sad?
Even though the news is sad, try to tell it in a cheerful manner.
If you're good, you're ruining the good news by telling it to me with such a sour expression.
I am tired.
Allow me a moment.
Ugh, my bones hurt so much!
I wish you had my bones and I had your news.
Can't you stay for a little while?
Can't you see that I'm out of breath?
Why are you out of breath when you have enough breath to tell me that you are out of breath?
The excuse you're making for this delay is longer than the story you're excusing.
Is your news good or bad?
What is the answer to that?
Say it, and I'll stick around to hear the details.
Let me be content.
Is it good or bad?
Well, you have made a simple decision. 
You don't know how to pick a man.
Romeo, where art thou?
No, not him, even though his face is better than any man's, his leg is better than all men's, and as for his hand, foot, and body, they may not be worth discussing, but they are incomparable.
He's not very polite, but I guarantee he's as gentle as a lamb.
Go on your way, girl.
Worship God.
Have you eaten at home?
Absolutely not.
I already knew all of this.
What does he say about our marriage?
What about that?
My back is hurting on the other side.
Oh, my back, my back! My back is killing me!
Honestly, I'm sorry that you're not feeling well.
Sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what does my love say?
Your love speaks like a true gentleman, polite, kind, handsome, and I'm sure, virtuous. Where is your mother?
Where is my mother?
"Hey, she's inside."
Where is she supposed to be?
Why are you responding so strangely?
Your love asks, like a decent man, "Where is your mother?"
Oh my dear lady, are you feeling so warm?
Wow, come on, I believe.
Is this the remedy for my sore bones?
From now on, handle your own messages.
There's such a commotion.
Hey, what's up Romeo?
Do you have permission to go to confession today?
I have.
Then go quickly to Friar Lawrence's cell.
There is a husband waiting to marry you.
Now your cheeks are blushing with desire.
They will be in red immediately upon hearing any news.
Go to church.
I need to find another way to get a ladder so that your love can climb up to a bird's nest when it's dark.
Let's go.
I'm going to dinner.
Go to the cell.
I only want to keep the peace.
Put down your sword, or help me separate these men.
What's up, are we going to fight or are we going to talk about making peace?
I hate the word as much as I hate hell, all Montagues, and you.
Come at me, coward!
Clubs, weapons, and supporters!
Hit!
Knock them out!
We're against the Capulets!
We don't want the Montagues around!
What is that sound?
I say, give me my sword!
Old Montague has arrived and is waving his sword at me in defiance.
You villain, Capulet!
You should not move a single step to look for an enemy.
Go seek out great success!
Goodbye, honest nurse.
Truly, truly.
No matter how much sadness may come, it can't compare to the happiness I feel when I see her for just a minute.
So, just love in moderation.
Love lasts a long time.
Arriving too quickly is just as late as arriving too slowly.
The lady is coming.
Oh, a light foot will never wear out the everlasting flint.
Hello to my spiritual advisor.
Romeo will thank you, daughter, on behalf of both of us.
He is very grateful, perhaps even too much.
Oh Juliet, if your happiness matches mine, and you can express it better, then let your breath sweeten the air around us, and let music convey the joy we both feel in this meeting.
Conceit, with more substance than words, boasts about its content, not its decoration.
Come on, come with me, and we'll get this done quickly.
Good Mercutio, let's go.
You're just like those guys who walk into a bar, slam their sword on the table and say "I hope I don't have to use you," but end up pulling it on the bartender after just one drink, even though there's no real reason to.
Do I really seem like that kind of person?
Come on, you're as hot-tempered as anyone in Italy, and just as quick to get moody and be provoked.
"What should we do?"
No, if there were two of them, we wouldn't have either for long because one would kill the other.
Why do you want to pick a fight with someone just because they have a little more or a little less hair in their beard than you do?
You will argue with a man for cracking nuts, only because you have hazel eyes and no other reason.
Who else but someone with keen observation skills would notice such a conflict?
Your head is always filled with arguments, just like an egg is filled with meat. And yet, your head has been scrambled from all the fighting.
You argued with a guy for coughing in the street because he woke up your dog that was sleeping in the sun.
Didn't you have a falling out with a tailor for wearing his new jacket before Easter?
Is he replacing his new shoes with old ribbon for lacing them up?
But you still want to teach me not to fight!
If I were as quick to argue as you are, someone would pay a lot of money for just a short amount of time with me.
Do you own the property outright?
Oh, how simple!
By my head, the Capulets are coming.
I don't care at all.
Combine it with something.
Let's settle this with words or fists.
You'll find me ready for that, sir, if you give me a reason.
Can't you do something without complaining?
Mercutio, you hang out with Romeo.
Why are you making us entertainers?
If you turn us into musicians, be prepared to hear nothing but disagreements.
We are speaking here in a public place.
You can either go somewhere private and calmly discuss your complaints, or you can leave.
Everyone is looking at us here.
Men's eyes were created to see and allow them to gaze.
I will not move for anyone's enjoyment, I.
Well, sir, peace be with you.
My man is coming.
I swear, sir, he won't be wearing your uniform.
Tybalt, I have a good reason to love you, which excuses my anger at your behavior.
I am not a villain.
So, goodbye.
I see that you don't know me.
Dude, this won't make up for the harm you've caused me.
So, turn around and get your weapon ready.
And so, Mr. Capulet, whose name I hold as dearly as my own, please be content.
Oh, what a disgraceful and shameful act of submission!
What do you want from me?
Will you pull your sword out of its sheath by the handle?
Hurry up, or my anger will be upon you before it's too late.
I am here for you.
Hey Mercutio, put away your sword.
Get out of here, Tybalt.
I am injured.
A curse on both your families!
I am done.
Has he left and has nothing?
Are you hurt?
Indeed, that is sufficient.
Where is my servant? Go, you scoundrel, and bring a doctor.
Be brave, dude.
The injury isn't too bad.
No, it's not as deep as a well or as wide as a church door, but it's enough, it will do.
Ask for me tomorrow, and you will find me to be a serious person.
I am sure I am well seasoned for this world.
A curse on both your families!
Wow, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat could scratch a man to death!
A bragger, a scoundrel, a villain who fights using calculations!
Why did you come between us?
I got hurt under your arm.
I thought it was for the best.
Benvolio, please help me find a house to rest in or I might faint.
A curse on both your families!
They have turned me into worm food.
I have it, and I have it securely as well.
"Your homes!"
Oh Romeo, Romeo, Mercutio is dead, brave Mercutio is dead!
Here comes Tybalt, all fired up again.
Alive and victorious, while Mercutio is dead!
Either you or I, or both of us, must go with him.
You, miserable boy, who associated with him here, will go with him from here.
This will decide that.
Romeo, go away, leave!
The people are angry, and Tybalt is dead.
Don't be surprised.
The prince will sentence you to death if you are caught.
Therefore, leave and go away!
Why are you staying?
Which way did the person who killed Mercutio run?
Tybalt, the murderer, which way did he run?
Tybalt is lying over there.
Talk, nephew.
Were you there when it started?
Where are the despicable instigators of this fight?
Oh noble prince, I can tell you all about the unfortunate outcome of this deadly fight.
There's the guy, killed by young Romeo, who also killed your relative, brave Mercutio.
Tybalt, my cousin!
Oh, my nephew!
Hey cousin, cousin!
Benvolio, who started this fight?
Romeo shouts, "Wait, guys!"
Friends, let's go our separate ways! And quicker than his words, his quick arm knocks down their deadly weapons, and he rushes between them. Under his arm, Tybalt's jealous thrust hit the life of brave Mercutio, and then Tybalt ran away.
But soon Romeo returns, still filled with anger, and they fight fiercely like lightning. Before I could intervene, Tybalt was killed.
As he fell, Romeo turned and ran away.
This is the truth, or Benvolio will die.
He is not speaking the truth.
About twenty of them fought in this dark conflict, and all of those twenty could only take one life.
I ask for justice, which you, prince, must provide.
Romeo killed Tybalt.
Romeo cannot be allowed to live.
Romeo killed him; he killed Mercutio.
Who owes the price of his own blood now?
His fault only results in what the law should determine, the death of Tybalt.
I am interested in what you are planning to do.
I'll hit you with such a heavy fine that you'll all regret causing me harm.
I will not listen to any begging or excuses.
Neither crying nor begging will buy forgiveness for mistreatment, so don't bother trying.
Take this body away and do as we say.
Mercy only encourages more killing by forgiving those who commit murder.
Lovers can perform their romantic rituals by admiring each other's beauty, or, if love is blind, it is most fitting to do so at night.
Come, calm night, dressed in dark clothes, and teach me how to lose a game that was played for the virginity of two young women.
Cover my blushing face with your dark cloak until this new love becomes more confident and realizes that true love is shown through modesty.
Come on, night.
Come on, Romeo.
Come, day in night, for you will lie on the wings of night whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
When I die, turn me into little stars and scatter me in the sky. I'll make the night sky so beautiful that everyone will fall in love with it and ignore the bright sun.
Did Romeo ask you to get the ropes?
Yes, yes, the strings.
Oh no, what's the news?
Why are you wringing your hands?
Oh, well, alas!
We are finished, lady, we are finished!
Oh no!
Is heaven really that jealous?
Romeo is able to do it, even though heaven cannot.
Who are you that's causing me so much torment?
This torture should be screamed in a miserable hell.
Did Romeo kill himself?
If you just say "yes," it's as deadly as the eye of a cockatrice.
I am not myself if there is someone or something that can make you say "yes" with closed eyes. If he is killed, say "yes," or if not, say "no." Quick sounds will decide my fate.
Never again shall your eyes gaze upon freedom as you are confined to prison.
Despicable earth, return to the earth.
Oh Tybalt, Tybalt, you were the best friend I ever had!
I can't believe I'm seeing you dead.
Has Romeo been killed, and is Tybalt dead?
My beloved cousin and my even dearer lord?
Tybalt has departed, and Romeo has been exiled.
Oh God, did Romeo kill Tybalt?
Yes, it did.
Oh no, it happened.
Oh, you deceitful person with a beautiful appearance!
Has any dragon ever had such a beautiful cave?
Feathered raven, lamb that acts like a wolf!
Oh nature, why did you allow a wicked spirit to inhabit such a beautiful body in this moral paradise?
Has there ever been a book with such disgusting content that was so nicely covered?
Oh, where is my guy? Can I have a drink? All this sadness is making me feel old.
Romeo should be ashamed!
May your tongue be cursed for making such a wish!
He was not meant to be ashamed.
Shame is too embarrassed to be on his face, because it's a place where honor can be celebrated.
I was such a fool to criticize the sole ruler of the entire world!
Will you speak positively about the person who killed your cousin?
Why did you kill my cousin, you villain?
My cousin, the villain, would have murdered my husband.
This is all comforting.
Why am I crying?
I would like to forget it, but oh, it keeps coming back to my memory, like guilty deeds haunting sinners' minds.
Tybalt has been killed, and Romeo has been exiled.
The word "banished" has caused the deaths of ten thousand Tybalts.
Tybalt's death was already tragic, but it didn't stop there.
If sorrow enjoys company and wants to be compared to other griefs, why didn't she mention "Tybalt's dead," "your father," or "your mother," or even both? Those are things that would make people cry nowadays.
After Tybalt's death, Romeo is banished. To say that word is to acknowledge that father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, and Juliet are all dead.
Romeo has been banished. The word "death" has no end, limit, measure, or boundary.
Those words cannot express that sorrow.
Nurse, where are my father and mother?
Crying and mourning over Tybalt's body.
Are you going to go see them?
I will take you there.
Are they washing his wounds with tears?
I will use up all of my tears while theirs are still flowing, all because Romeo has been banished.
Pick up those ropes, unfortunate strings, you have been deceived, both you and I, because Romeo has been banished.
He created you to be a path to my bed, but I, a virgin, die without ever having been married.
Death, not Romeo, will take my virginity!
Go to your room.
I will find Romeo to comfort you.
I know exactly where he is.
Listen, your Romeo will be here tonight.
I will talk to him.
He is hiding at Lawrence's cell.
Romeo, come out.
Step forward, you scaredy-cat.
Father, what's the latest?
My son is spending too much time with bad influences.
I have news about the prince's fate to tell you.
What could be worse than the prince's punishment?
Ah, banishment!
Have mercy and just say "death" because being exiled is way scarier than dying.
Don't say "banishment." You're being banished from Verona.
Be patient, because the world is vast and expansive.
There is no world outside of Verona's walls but purgatory, torture, and hell itself.
Therefore, "banished" is removed from the world, and being exiled from the world means death.
You call death "banishment," but you're really just killing me with a smile on your face.
Oh, what a terrible sin!
Oh, how rude and ungrateful!
It's torture, not mercy.
Carrion flies have more validity, a more honorable state, and more courtship than Romeo.
Flies can do that, but I have to get away from it.
They are free, but I am banished.
Do you still believe that being exiled is not as bad as death?
Did you not have any poison, sharp knife, or any other way to kill me, even if it was simple, other than being banished? Banished!
Oh friar, people in hell use that word.
It is accompanied by howling.
How could you, as a holy man, a spiritual advisor, a forgiver of sins, and my proclaimed friend, have the heart to hurt me with the word "banished"?
You crazy fool, listen to me for a moment.
Your enemy's servants and yours were fighting closely before I arrived.
I stepped in to separate them.
As we were exchanging attacks and blows, more and more people joined the fight until the prince arrived and separated everyone.
Oh, where can Romeo be?
Did you see him today?
I'm really glad he wasn't involved in the fight.
I approached him, but he noticed me and quickly disappeared into the woods.
He has been seen there many mornings, crying and making the morning dew even heavier with his tears, and adding more clouds to the sky with his deep sighs.
But as soon as the sun starts to rise in the east and light begins to fill the sky, my lazy son sneaks back home.
Oh, you're going to talk about banishment again.
Let's not talk anymore.
Oh, I realize that crazy people don't listen.
How can they see, when wise men have no eyes?
Let's talk about your situation.
You can't talk about something you don't feel.
If you were as young as I am, Juliet, and we had only been married for an hour before Tybalt was killed, you would be as crazy with grief as I am and would be banished like me. Then you could speak, tear your hair, and fall to the ground like I am doing now, feeling like I am in an unmarked grave.
Get up.
Someone is knocking.
Romeo, you should hide.
I won't hide unless the sound of sad sighs surrounds me like a mist, hiding me from being seen.
Who is knocking so loudly?
Where do you come from?
What do you want?
Oh holy friar, please tell me, where is my lady's husband?
Where is Romeo?
Oh, he is even in the same situation as my mistress, just like her.
Oh, what a sad situation, full of pity!
She's lying there, crying and sobbing, sobbing and crying.
Stand up if you're a man.
For Juliet's sake, please stand up.
Why would you let yourself fall into such a deep despair?
Nurse!
Oh sir, oh sir.
Death is the end of everything.
Are you talking about Juliet?
How is she doing?
Where is she?
"How is she doing?"
What does my hidden lady say about our ended love?
It's like that name killed her just like a bullet from a gun, just like that name's cursed hand killed her relative.
Oh, tell me, friar, where in this body does my name reside?
Tell me so that I can destroy the detestable house.
Are you a man?
Your wild behavior shows the irrational anger of an animal.
You have surprised me.
I thought you were more level-headed, by my sacred oath.
Did you kill Tybalt?
Why do you complain about your birth, the heavens, and the earth?
Shame on you for wasting your looks, your love, and your intelligence. You have so much to offer, but you don't use any of it to truly enhance yourself.
Wake up, man!
Your Juliet is alive, for whom you were recently thought to be dead, and now you are happy.
Tybalt wanted to kill you, but you killed him instead. So, you should be happy about that.
The law that once threatened to kill you now becomes your ally and instead banishes you, but you will find happiness there.
May a bunch of blessings come your way, and may happiness be with you in all its glory.
However, you act like a spoiled and sulky girl, sulking about your luck and your love.
Go, and fulfill the decree by going to your love.
Go to her room and comfort her.
Give my regards to your lady and tell her to hurry everyone in the house to bed, as their sadness is making them tired.
Romeo is on his way.
Oh lord, I could have stayed here all night to hear good advice.
Oh, how wonderful learning is!
Go ahead and tell my sweetheart to get ready to scold me.
Here, sir, she asked me to give you this ring, sir.
Hurry up, it's getting really late.
I feel so much better because of this!
Leave now.
Have a good night.
Here is your situation: leave before the guards are posted, or disguise yourself and leave before daybreak.
Stay in Mantua.
I will find your man and he will keep you updated on all the good things that happen here.
Give me your hand.
It's getting late.
Goodbye.
Sir, things have fallen out so unluckily that we haven't had time to move our daughter.
Listen, she loved her cousin Tybalt very much, and so did I.
Well, we were born to die. 
In these difficult times, there's no time for romance.
Madam, have a good night.
Give my regards to your daughter.
I will meet with her and find out what she's thinking tomorrow morning.
Tonight she is confined to her sadness.
Sir Paris, I will earnestly offer my child's love.
Let her know that my son Paris loves her, and tell her to be ready for our wedding next Wednesday. Oh, wait!
What day is it today?
Monday, my lord.
It's Monday!
Haha.
Do you like being in a rush?
We won't make a big fuss, just a friend or two.
Listen, if Tybalt was killed so recently, people might think we didn't care about him because he's our relative, if we party too much.
So we'll have about six friends, and that's it.
What do you think about Thursday?
My lord, I wish Thursday was tomorrow.
We will make you leave.
"Okay, it's settled then. Before you go to bed, go see Juliet on Thursday."
Will you leave?
It's not close to morning yet.
It was the nightingale, not the lark, that pierced your fearful ear.
Hey, look, love, see those jealous streaks in the sky over there in the east.
The night's candles have burned out, and the cheerful day is standing on the misty mountain tops.
That light is not daylight, I know it.
It's like a shooting star that the sun sends out to be a guide for you tonight, to light your way to Mantua.
So, stick around for a little while longer.
You don't need to leave.
Take me away.
I want to be executed.
I am happy with it, if that's what you want.
I'd rather stay than leave.
Death, come and welcome!
Let's have a conversation.
It's not daytime.
It is what it is.
The lark is singing off-key, making unpleasant sounds.
Some people say that the lark sings sweetly.
She doesn't do that, she's driving us apart.
It's getting brighter and brighter.
Our sorrows are getting darker and darker, while our joys are fading away.
Madam, I ask of you.
What's up, nurse?
Your mother is coming to your room.
The day has dawned.
Now, open the window and let the day in, and let life out.
Goodbye, goodbye.
Give me a kiss, and I will come down.
He locks himself in his room, closes the windows, shuts out the sunlight, and creates his own darkness.
My dear uncle, do you know what's going on?
I don't know it and I can't find out from him.
Have you bothered him in any way?
I wish you were so pleased to stay and hear the truth. Come on, let's go, madam.
Are you leaving so soon, my love, my lord?
Oh, by the time I see Romeo again, I'll be much older.
Goodbye!
I won't miss any chance to send my greetings and love to you.
Oh, do you think we will ever meet again?
Oh God, I have a bad feeling about this.
I think I see you now, you look as low as a dead person at the bottom of a tomb.
Either my eyes are failing me, or you look pale.
And believe me, my love, you look just as beautiful in my eyes.
Our blood is drunk by sorrow.
Goodbye, goodbye!
Oh luck, luck!
Everyone thinks you're unreliable.
Be unpredictable, luck, because I hope you won't keep him for long, but send him back.
Who is calling?
Is that my mother, lady?
What brings her here that she is not used to?
What's up, Juliet?
Madam, I am not feeling well.
Are you still crying over your cousin's death?
Will you wash his grave with tears?
Even if you could, you couldn't make him live.
So, it's been done.
Some sadness shows a lot of love, but a lot of sadness still shows a lack of intelligence.
But I still want to cry for such a great loss.
You will feel the loss, but not the friend you are mourning.
I feel the loss so deeply, I can't help but cry for my friend.
Hey, girl, you're not crying so much for his death, but because the villain who killed him is still alive.
Who's the villain, ma'am?
That guy Romeo is such a villain.
That's because the traitorous murderer is still alive.
Yes, madam, out of my reach.
I wish only I could avenge my cousin's death!
Stop crying.
I'll send someone to Mantua, where that banished scoundrel lives, and they'll give him a potion that will make him join Tybalt soon enough.
And then, I hope you will be satisfied.
I will never be satisfied with Romeo until I see him dead. My heart is troubled for a relative.
Madam, if you could just find someone to get a poison, I would dilute it so that Romeo could peacefully fall asleep after taking it.
I wanted to avenge my love for my cousin by killing the person who murdered him!
You find a way, and I'll find a man.
But now I will tell you some good news, girl.
And happiness is much needed in a time like this.
What are they, please tell me, your ladyship?
Well, well, you have a cautious father, my child.
Madam, what day is it today?
My dear, next Thursday morning, the handsome, young, and noble gentleman, County Paris, will happily marry you at Saint Peter's church and make you his joyful bride.
No way, by Saint Peter's church and Peter himself, he won't make me a happy bride there.
I can't believe how quickly I have to get married before the man who should be my husband even has a chance to court me.
Please tell my father and lord, madam, that I will not marry yet.
And when I do, I promise it will be Romeo, who you know I hate, instead of Paris.
Wow, this is really surprising news!
Your father is coming.
Tell him yourself and see how he reacts.
What's up?
"Are you a messenger, girl?"
Why are you still crying all the time?
Did you give her the message we sent?
I wish that idiot would just marry his grave already!
Why won't she?
Isn't she proud?
Doesn't she consider herself lucky, even though she doesn't deserve it, that we have found such a worthy man to marry her?
You should be grateful for what you have, not boastful.
Why, why, why, why?
This logic is all over the place!
What is this?
Arrogant, "and" I appreciate it, "and" I don't appreciate it, "and yet" not arrogant?
Get out of here, you disgusting, sickly person!
Get out of here, you worthless person!
You pale-faced coward!
Shame, shame!
Are you crazy?
Dear father, I beg you to listen to me patiently as I speak.
Don't speak.
Do not respond.
Get out of here, you worthless person!
May God in heaven bless her!
My lord, you are at fault for treating her that way.
And why, my lady wisdom? 
Why do you ask, my wise lady?
What's the matter with your gossip? Go away.
I do not speak treason.
Oh, God, I wish you a good evening.
Can't I speak?
Calm down, you incoherent idiot!
Speak seriously over a gossip's drink, because we don't need it here.
You are too attractive.
Goodness gracious!
It angers me.
Throughout the day and night, at all times, whether alone or with others, my main concern has been to find a suitable match for her.
Thursday is approaching.
Put your hand on your heart and give me your advice.
If you agree to be with me, I'll introduce you to my friend.
Trust me, think about it.
I will not break my promise.
Postpone this wedding for a month, or a week.
If you don't, then make the wedding bed in the tomb where Tybalt lies.
Don't talk to me, because I won't say anything.
Do whatever you want, because I'm finished with you.
Oh God, oh nurse, how can we stop this from happening?
My husband is on earth, but my faith is in heaven.
How can that ring come back to earth unless my husband sends it to me from heaven by leaving earth?
Please, make me feel better.
Don't you have anything happy to say?
"Please bring me some comfort, nurse."
Oh, he's a really nice guy.
Romeo is nothing but a rag to him.
Madam, Paris has an eye that is not as green, quick, and fair as an eagle's.
Curse my heart, I believe you are pleased with this new relationship, as it surpasses the previous one.
If it didn't, your firstborn is dead, or it would be just as good if he were, as living here and you have no use for him.
Are you speaking from your heart?
So be it!
What is that?
Well, you have comforted me greatly.
Go and tell my lady that I have left because I have angered my father. I am going to Lawrence's cell to confess and seek forgiveness.
Well, I agree, and that's a smart move.
Oh, you evil demon!
I will go to the friar to find out his solution.
If everything else fails, I have the power to die.
Is Thursday okay, sir?
There's not much time left.
You're saying you don't know what the lady is thinking.
I do not like it.
Do you know why we're in such a hurry now?
Hey, look, here comes the lady walking towards my cell.
I'm so glad to see you, my lady and my wife.
Perhaps, sir, when I am ready to be a wife.
Good morning, cousin.
Is it still early in the day?
It's just nine o'clock.
Did my father just leave in such a hurry?
It was.
Lacking what they have makes them feel incomplete.
Are you in love?
Go away.
What is love?
Where should we eat? Oh my!
Love must be on Thursday next, that "may be."
What will be, will be.
That is a specific message.
Are you here to confess to this father?
To respond to that, I should confess to you.
Don't refuse to admit that you love me to him.
I have to admit that I love him.
I'm sure that you love me, too.
If I do that, it will be more valuable if it's said behind your back than to your face.
Oh, poor thing, your face is so swollen from crying.
Your face belongs to me, and you have insulted it.
I have some free time now, my thoughtful daughter. We should ask for some time alone, my lord.
May God forbid that I should interrupt your prayers, Juliet. I will wake you up early on Thursday.
Oh Juliet, I already understand your pain.
I hear you have to get married to this county next Thursday, and there's no way to delay it.
Don't tell me, friar, that you've heard about this unless you also tell me how I can stop it.
If you can't help me with your wisdom, just acknowledge that my decision is wise, and I'll take care of it with this knife right away.
Wait a moment.
Wednesday is tomorrow.
Make sure you sleep alone tomorrow night.
Do not let the nurse sleep in your room with you.
You show no signs of life, no warmth, no breath.
Give it to me, give it to me!
Love gives me strength, and strength will help me.
Goodbye, dad.
You won't have any trouble, sir, because I'll see if they can clean their plates.
How can you test them like that?
So, if you can't adapt and make the best of a situation, then I don't want to be associated with you.
Go away, leave.
We will be very unprepared for this time.
Oh, indeed.
Look, she's coming from confession with a happy expression.
I have learned to repent for disobeying you and going against your wishes, and I am now required by Friar Lawrence to kneel and ask for your forgiveness.
Summon the sheriff.
Go and tell him about this.
I will have this knot tied up by tomorrow morning.
I met the young lord at Lawrence's cell and showed him as much love as was appropriate, without being immodest.
I'm happy about it.
This is good.
Rise to your feet.
Yes, go and bring him here now. This holy friar is truly respected and revered.
Our entire city owes him a lot.
Nurse, can you come with me to my closet and help me pick out the necessary accessories for my outfit tomorrow?
No, not until Thursday.
There is plenty of time.
We will go to church tomorrow.
It's almost nighttime now.
Psh, I'll take care of everything and make sure it's all good, I promise, wife.
Go to Juliet and help her get ready.
I will not go to bed tonight.
Leave me alone.
I'll play the housewife for this one time.
Wow, those outfits look great.
Are you busy, my friend?
Do you need my help?
I'm sure you have a lot on your plate with all this sudden business.
Have a good night.
Goodbye! Who knows when we will see each other again.
I have to go through this sad situation by myself.
Come, let us go.
What if this combination doesn't work at all?
Will I be getting married tomorrow morning?
You can just lie there.
Wow, look at that!
I think I see my cousin's ghost looking for Romeo, who stabbed him with a sword.
Don't go, Tybalt, don't go!
Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?
Here's a drink.
I drink to you.
No, because I would rather cry.
What do you mean by "good heart"?
Why, that's just how love goes wrong.
What else is it?
A clever form of madness, a suffocating bitterness, and a soothing sweetness.
Goodbye, cousin.
Be gentle!
I will go with you.
If you leave me like this, you're doing me wrong.
Darn, I've lost my way.
I am not present.
Please tell me, with a heavy heart, who is it that you love.
Should I really groan and tell you?
Ugh!
Why, no.
Unfortunately, please tell me who.
Hold on to these keys and go get more spices, nurse.
They want dates and quinces in the pastry.
Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go!
The second rooster has crowed.
The curfew bell has rung.
Do not hesitate to spend the money.
Get out of here, you scoundrel.
Go to bed, seriously.
You will be sick tomorrow from staying up late tonight.
I have stayed up all night for less important reasons before, and I've never gotten sick.
Hey, you've been sneaky in the past, but I'll be keeping an eye on you from now on.
A jealous fool, a jealous fool!
Hey, buddy, what's up?
Hurry up, hurry up, buddy.
I have a clever mind, sir, that can figure things out without bothering anyone else.
A great speech, well spoken.
A jolly bastard, huh!
You will be a fool, I swear, it's daytime.
My dear wife!
Hey, what's up?
What's up, nurse!
Go wake up Juliet.
Go and tidy her up.
I will go talk to Paris.
Hurry up, move quickly, move quickly.
The groom has already arrived.
Hurry up, I say.
Madam!
What, ma'am!
Juliet, she's quick, I guarantee it. Why, she's like a lamb!
What's up, lady!
Why, my love, I say.
Excuse me, ma'am!
My love!
Wow, bride!
What, no one has anything to say?
You're getting your money's worth now.
She's sound asleep!
Hey, let the hospital take care of you in your bed.
He will scare you, I swear.
Won't it be?
What's that sound?
Oh, what a terrible day!
What's wrong?
"Hey, check this out."
Oh, what a heavy day!
Oh, woe is me!
My child, my only reason for living, wake up, or I will die with you! Help, help!
Shame on you, bring Juliet out.
Her husband has arrived.
She's dead, she's passed away, she's no longer with us.
Oh no!
Oh no.
She's gone, she's gone, she's gone!
What did you say?
Allow me to see her.
Oh no, unfortunately!
She is cold.
Her blood has calmed, and her joints are stiff.
Life and these lips have been apart for a long time.
Her death is like an early frost on the most beautiful flower in the field.
Oh, what a terrible day!
Oh, what a terrible time.
Death has taken her away and made me cry, it has silenced me and I cannot speak.
Hey, is the bride ready to go to the church?
Prepared to leave, but never to come back.
Death is married to my daughter.
Death is my inheritance.
He has married my daughter.
I will die and leave everything to him.
Everything in life is ultimately controlled by death.
Have I waited so long to see the morning, only to be greeted with this sight?
Cursed, miserable, wretched, hateful day!
The most miserable hour that time has ever seen in the enduring toil of his journey.
I only had one, poor and loving child, my only source of joy and comfort, and cruel death has taken it away from me!
Oh no!
Oh, what a terrible, terrible, terrible day!
This day has never been so dark.
Oh, what a terrible day, what a terrible day!
Tricked, abandoned, mistreated, offended, killed!
You have caused the most detestable death, cruelly overthrowing me.
Oh, love!
Oh, life!
It's not about life, but about love in death.
I despise, distress, hate, martyr, and kill!
Why did you come to ruin our celebration at such an inconvenient time?
My soul, not my child!
You are dead!
Peace, hey, stop it!
The solution to confusion does not lie within these confusing circumstances.
Heaven and you had a hand in creating this beautiful girl.
Now heaven has everything.
And it's even better for the girl.
You couldn't prevent her from dying, but heaven will keep her soul alive forever.
You only wanted her to get promoted, because it was your wish for her to move up in the world.
Are you crying now, seeing that she has risen above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
Oh, in this love, you love your child so poorly that you go crazy, even though she is well.
It's better to marry young and die young than to live a long married life in an unhappy marriage.
Our music sounds like sad bells, and our celebration feels more like a funeral.
We go from singing happy songs to sad ones, our wedding flowers are now used for a funeral, and everything seems to be the opposite of what it was before.
Everyone get ready to accompany this beautiful body to her grave.
The skies are frowning at you for some wrongdoing. Don't provoke them further by defying their authority.
Indeed, we can stop playing our instruments and leave.
Yes, indeed, the situation can be improved.
We are not a dump.
It's not the time to play now.
You won't do that then?
I cannot.
I will give it to you thoroughly.
What are you going to give us?
I have no money, I swear, except for a little bit.
I will give you the musician.
I will give you the servant.
I will then put the servant's dagger on your head.
I will not entertain any doubts.
Then I'll challenge you with my cleverness.
Respond to me like adults.
Certainly, sir, because silver has a pleasant sound.
What do you think, James Soundpost? Do you talk too much?
I don't know what to say about faith.
I will speak on your behalf.
It's "music with its beautiful sound" because musicians don't have gold to make noise.
This guy is such a pest!
String him up, Jack!
If I can believe the comforting truth of sleep, my dreams predict that there is some happy news coming soon.
Oh no!
Love is so sweet when even just the thought of love brings so much happiness!
What's the news from Verona, Balthasar?
Don't you bring me letters from the friar?
How is my lady doing?
Is my father doing okay?
How is my Juliet doing?
I ask again, because if she's okay, then nothing can be wrong.
If she's okay, then everything is fine.
Her body rests in the Capulet's tomb, while her eternal soul resides with the angels.
I saw her lying in her family's tomb and immediately rushed to tell you.
Oh, sorry for bringing you this bad news, but you did ask me to handle it, sir.
A sick man in sadness writes his will, speaking unkindly to someone who is also unwell.
I'm sad to say, cousin, I love a woman.
An excellent marksman!
I love her because she is beautiful.
A good target, my friend, is easiest to hit.
Well, you missed the mark with that one.
She has, and by being so frugal, she actually wastes a lot. Because her strictness causes beauty to starve, it prevents beauty from being passed down to future generations.
She is too beautiful, too intelligent, and too kind to deserve happiness by causing me to feel hopeless.
Let me be in charge.
Don't forget to think about her.
Oh, teach me how to stop thinking!
Is that really true?
I challenge you, fate!
You know where I live.
Fetch me some ink and paper, and arrange for some fast horses.
I will leave from here tonight.
Sir, please be patient with me.
You look pale and disheveled, and it seems like something bad has happened.
Oh, you're mistaken.
Go away and do what I told you to do.
Do you have any letters for me from the friar?
No, my lord.
It doesn't matter.
Go away and rent those horses.
I'll be with you right away.
Well, Juliet, I will sleep with you tonight.
Let's find out what it means.
Oh mischief, you quickly enter the minds of desperate men!
I think this is the house.
Since it's a holiday, the beggar's shop is closed.
Hey there!
Hey, apothecary!
Who is shouting so loudly?
Come here, man.
I see that you are poor.
Stop, there are forty ducats.
Are you so poor and miserable, and afraid to die?
You look hungry.
Your eyes show hunger and suffering.
The world is not your friend, and the world's law is not either.
The world doesn't have any laws that can make you rich.
Purchase some food and nourish yourself. Come, take this potion with me to Juliet's tomb, it is a remedy, not poison. I must use it there.
Wow, a Franciscan friar!
Hey, brother!
This should be the message from Friar John.
Greetings from Mantua.
What is Romeo saying?
Or, if he has made up his mind, give me his letter.
My journey to Mantua was delayed.
Who delivered my letter to Romeo?
Unfortunate luck!
Brother, I'll go and bring it to you.
I have to go to the monument by myself now.
Fair Juliet will wake within the next three hours.
I will send another letter to Mantua and keep her in my cell until Romeo arrives.
Unfortunate soul, trapped in a tomb!
Hand me your torch, kid.
Go away and stay apart.
But extinguish it, because I don't want to be seen.
Hand over those flowers to me.
Do as I tell you, go.
But I will take the risk.
The boy is warning that something is approaching.
Who the heck is coming this way to ruin my funeral and my true love's ceremony?
What a torch!
Cover me, night, for a little while.
Give me the pickaxe and the crowbar.
I'll be leaving, sir, and won't bother you.
You will prove your friendship to me in this way.
Take that.
Young man, please don't provoke someone who is desperate.
Go away and leave me alone.
Consider these past events.
Don't let them scare you.
I beg you, young person, don't make me even angrier by urging me to sin.
Oh, go away!
Don't stay, go away.
Live, and in the future, a madman's mercy will tell you to run away.
I reject your threat and I'm arresting you for a crime.
Are you trying to provoke me?
Come on, let's fight!
Oh my god, they're fighting!
I will go and get the police.
Please open the tomb.
Mercutio's relative, the noble Count Paris.
What did my man say when I wasn't paying attention as we rode?
I believe he said that Paris was supposed to marry Juliet.
Did he not say so?
Did I just imagine that?
I will bury you in a victorious grave.
Is this a serious matter?
Oh no.
A lantern, a slain young person, for here lies Juliet, and her beauty illuminates this tomb like a bright presence.
Death has not yet had any power over your beauty, even though it has taken your life.
You are not defeated.
Oh, what else can I do for you, than to use the same hand that killed your youth to also kill the one who was your enemy?
Should I believe that death, a non-existent entity, is in love, and that the thin, hated monster is keeping you here in the dark to be his lover?
Here, I will stay with the worms that serve as your chambermaids.
Oh, I'm going to find a place to rest forever and get rid of the bad luck that's been weighing me down.
Eyes, take one last look.
Arms, give me one last hug.
Your drugs are fast.
And so, with a kiss, I die.
These smiling masks that kiss the foreheads of beautiful women, but are black, remind us that they conceal the beauty.
May Saint Francis guide me!
How many times tonight have I tripped over graves with my old feet! Who's there?
Here is a friend who knows you well.
May you be blessed!
Hey friend, can you tell me what torch is over there that is shining its light on worthless things like grubs and eyeless skulls?
I can see that it's burning in the Capulet's tomb.
Who is that?
Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name. Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
How long has he been there?
For a whole thirty minutes.
Come with me to the tomb.
I can't do it, sir.
Remain here.
I will go by myself.
I am feeling afraid.
Oh, I'm afraid something bad is going to happen.
While I was sleeping under this yew tree, I dreamt that my master and another person were fighting, and my master killed him.
Romeo, oh no, what blood is this that stains the stone entrance of the tomb?
Oh, kind friar!
Where is my husband?
I remember exactly where I should be, and that's where I am.
Where is my Romeo?
I can hear some noise.
Woman, get away from that place of death, disease, and unnatural slumber.
A greater force has opposed our plans in a way that we cannot resist.
Let's go, come on.
Your husband is dead in your arms, and Paris is also dead.
Come, I will place you with a group of holy nuns.
Is there a cup held in my true love's hand?
I see that poison has been his timeless end. Oh, you selfish person, you drank it all and left me with no friendly drop to help me?
I will kiss your lips.
Maybe there is still some poison on them that could kill me, but also save me.
Yeah, what's that noise?
I'll be quick.
Oh happy dagger, this is where you belong.
Let me rust and die.
This is the place.
There, where the torch is burning.
The ground is covered in blood. Let's go check out the churchyard.
What a sad sight!
The county is dead, and Juliet is bleeding, warm and newly deceased. She has been buried here for two days. Go and tell the prince.
Go to the Capulets' house.
Lift up the Montagues.
Some others are searching.
Here is Romeo's friend.
We discovered him in the churchyard.
Keep him safe until the prince arrives here.
There's a friar who's shaking, sighing, and crying.
We took this pickaxe and shovel from him as he was leaving the churchyard.
There is a strong suspicion.
Also, the friar should stay.
What unfortunate event is waking us up so early from our sleep?
What is it that everyone is talking about so loudly?
Oh, the people in the street are calling out "Romeo," some are calling out "Juliet," and some are calling out "Paris," and they are all running towards our monument with loud cries.
Look for and find out how this terrible murder happened.
Oh my goodness!
"Hey, wife, look at our daughter bleeding!"
This dagger has been mistaken, for his house is empty on the back of Montague, and it is lodged in my daughter's chest.
Oh, woe is me!
This reminder of death is like a bell that signals my old age leading to a grave.
Oh no, my lord, my wife has passed away tonight.
My son's exile has caused her so much grief that it has taken her breath away.
What other troubles are coming my way in my old age?
Look, and you will see.
Shut down the angry talk for now, until we can sort out these uncertainties and understand where they're coming from. Then I'll take charge of your problems and lead you all the way to death.
In the meantime, hold off and let bad luck be controlled by patience. Bring forward the people who are suspected.
I am the best, capable of doing the least, yet most suspected, as the time and place are against me, of this terrible murder.
Here I am, ready to accuse and absolve myself, both condemned and justified.
Then tell me immediately what you know about this.
I'll keep it short because I don't have much time to talk.
In the meantime, I wrote to Romeo, telling him to come here tonight to help me take her from her temporary grave, when the potion's effects wear off.
What can he say about this?
Their love story ended with the news of her death.
Montague! Hey, Montague!
Hey, Montague, give me your hand.
But now, my lord, what do you think of my request?
But repeating what I have already said.
My child is still unfamiliar with the world.
She has not seen the age of fourteen years.
Mothers are made happy when they are younger than she.
Those who are made too early are often ruined too soon.
But court her, kind Paris, win her heart.
Tonight I'm having my usual party and I've invited all my favorite people.
Two young lovers from the feuding families tragically end their lives, bringing an end to their parents' conflict through their own misfortunes.
The tragic story of their doomed love and their parents' ongoing anger, which only the death of their children could end, is now the focus of our play. If you listen carefully, we will do our best to fix any mistakes in the performance.
The feeling of comfort that strong young men experience when well-dressed April follows the slow, cold winter.
Tonight, you will also find such joy among the fresh fennel buds at my house.
Hey, buddy, walk around in beautiful Verona.
Can you figure out who these people are whose names are written here?
It is said that the shoemaker should stick to his measuring tape, the tailor to his shoe form, the fisherman to his rod, and the painter to his canvas.
I've been sent to find the people whose names are written here, but I can never figure out who wrote the names here.
Take some new medicine for your eye, and the harmful poison of the old one will go away.
Your plantain leaf is great for that.
What are you asking for?
Why are you mad, Romeo?
I'm not crazy, but I feel more trapped than a madman in prison. I'm being kept without food, whipped, and tormented. Good evening, my friend.
Good evening, God.
Excuse me, sir, can you read?
Oh, my luck in my suffering.
Maybe you've learned it without studying.
But I ask, can you read anything you see?
Hey, if I know how to read and write.
You speak the truth.
Remain here, my friend.
I am able to read.
Lord Martino and his family, Count Anselme and his beautiful sisters, the widow of Vitruvio, Lord Placentio and his lovely nieces, Mercutio and his brother Valentine, my uncle Capulet, his family, my beautiful niece Rosaline, and Livia.
"Lord Valentio and his cousin Tybalt, along with Lucio and the lively Helena, make for a great group."
Where should they go?
Rise up.
Where are you going?
Shall we have dinner?
Let's go to our house.
Whose house is it?
My master's.
Yes, I should have asked you that earlier.
Now I'll tell you without being asked.
My boss is the wealthy Capulet, and if you're not a Montague, I invite you to come and have a drink with us.
Have a good rest!
At the same old Capulet's party, the beautiful Rosaline, whom you love so much, will be there with all the admired beauties of Verona.
Go there, and with unbiased eyes compare her face with others that I will show you, and I will make you think your beautiful swan is actually an ugly crow.
Is there anyone more beautiful than my love?
The sun has never seen anyone like her since the beginning of the world.
I'll go with you, there's nothing to see, but to enjoy my own beauty.
Nurse, where is my daughter?
Summon her to come to me.
Now, when I was twelve years old, I told her to come by my virginity.
What's up, lamb?
Who's calling?
Your mom.
Madam, I am present.
What do you want?
You know my daughter is at a pretty age.
I swear, I can tell her exact age down to the hour.
She is not fourteen.
I'll bet fourteen of my teeth, and yet, truth be told, I only have four. She is not fourteen.
On Lammas Eve at night, she will be fourteen, whether it's an even or odd day of the year.
Susan and she, may all Christian souls rest in peace, were the same age.
Susan is in heaven now.
She was too good for me.
But, as I said, she will be fourteen on Lammas Eve at night.
She will do that.
Wow, I remember it well.
It's been eleven years since the earthquake, and she was weaned. I'll never forget that day, out of all the days of the year.
I had put bitter herbs on my nipple, while sitting in the sun under the dovecote wall.
My lord, you were in Mantua at that time. No, I do have a brain. But, like I said, when it tasted the bitterness of wormwood on my nipple and found it unpleasant, it was silly to get upset and reject the nipple!
"Shake!" said the dovehouse.
There was no need to tell me to leave, I think.
"Yeah," he said, "are you falling on your face?"
And, you silly fool, it stopped and said "yes." That's enough of this.
Please be quiet.
Certainly, ma'am.
I can't help but laugh when I think about how it left crying and said "yes." And I'm sure it had a huge bump on its forehead, like a young rooster's spur, from a dangerous blow, and it cried a lot.
Yes, my husband said, "Did you fall on your face?"
You will fall backward when you come of age.
Won't you, Juliet? "Yes," she replied. And you too, please stop, Nurse, say I.
May God bless you with his grace!
You were the cutest baby I ever nursed.
If I live to see you get married, my wish will come true.
Daughter Juliet, can you tell me how you feel about getting married?
I never even dreamed of such an honor.
Well, consider getting married now.
In Verona, there are already esteemed ladies who are younger than you and have become mothers.
According to my calculations, I have been your mother for many years, and now you are a young woman.
So, in short, Paris is looking for you because he loves you.
Excuse me, sir!
Verona's summer does not have a flower like that.
What do you say?
I'll see if I like it when I see it.
I won't gaze any deeper than you allow.
I have to go and wait.
I ask you to please follow directly.
We're coming with you, Juliet. The county is waiting for you.
Girl, go seek happy nights for happy days.
What, are we going to make this speech as our excuse?
Should we continue without apologizing?
The date is taking too long.
But let them judge us however they want.
Can I have a flashlight?
I am not in favor of this leisurely stroll.
No, Romeo, we need you to dance.
I don't believe you.
You have shoes for dancing with flexible soles.
My soul feels heavy and keeps me rooted to the ground, I can't move.
You're a lover.
Borrow Cupid's wings and fly above the ordinary limits.
I am too wounded by his arrows to fly with his light wings, and so constrained, I cannot rise above deep sorrow.
I am sinking under the heavy burden of love.
I mean, if we get angry, we'll fight.
I move quickly and strike.
But you are not easily provoked to fight.
Moving is stirring, and being brave is standing.
I won't be moved to stand by a dog from that house.
And if you were to fall into it, carrying the weight of love would be too much for something delicate.
Is love a delicate thing?
It's too harsh, too crude, too loud, and it stings like a thorn.
If love is tough on you, be tough on love.
Let carefree people with light hearts dance and kick the senseless grass with their heels.
Let's go, we're wasting time!
No, that's not true.
We waste our time in vain, like trying to use a flashlight during the day.
We have good intentions in attending this party, but it's not wise to go.
Why, can I ask?
I had a dream last night.
I did too.
So, what was your opinion?
Dreamers frequently deceive.
They are in bed asleep, dreaming of true things.
Oh, I see that Queen Mab has visited you.
Sometimes she runs over a courtier's nose, and then he dreams of sniffing out a lawsuit.
And sometimes she comes with a pig's tail and tickles a priest's nose as he sleeps, causing him to dream of getting another church position.
It's her, calm down, Mercutio, calm down!
The wind you're talking about is making us lose our sense of direction.
Dinner is over, and we're going to be late.
"Hey, strong and lively men."
Hit the drum.
Where is Potpan? Why isn't he helping to take this away?
It's a bad thing when only one or two people have good manners, and they're not even clean.
Get rid of the stools, take away the cupboard, and make sure the plates are in order.
Hey, can you save me some marchpane? And please, ask the porter to let Susan Grindstone and Nell in, if you love me. Antony and Potpan!
Hey, kid, are you ready?
You are wanted and summoned, requested and sought after, in the main room.
We can't be in two places at once.
"Come on, guys, let's cheer up."
Hurry up for a bit, and the one who lives longer gets everything.
Welcome, everyone!
The woman who is picky about her shoes, I swear, has bunions.
Am I getting closer to you now? Welcome, gentlemen!
By my lady, it has been thirty years.
It is more, it is more.
His son is older, sir.
His son is thirty years old.
Can you tell me that?
His son was only a minor two years ago.
I don't know, sir.
Oh, she teaches the torches to burn brightly!
I never saw true beauty until tonight.
Is this guy a Montague just by the sound of his voice? Who does this servant think he is, coming here with a ridiculous mask to mock and make fun of our celebration?
Why are you so angry?
Uncle, this guy is a Montague, our enemy. He's come here tonight just to mock our party.
Is that young Romeo?
It's him, that scoundrel Romeo.
Be at ease, my dear cousin.
Leave him be.
He carries himself like a respectable gentleman, and, to be honest, Verona boasts about him being a virtuous and well-behaved young man.
I wouldn't disrespect him for all the money in town, even in my own home.
So, just be patient.
Ignore him.
You will not tolerate him!
Why, uncle, it's a disgrace.
"Go, go, go!"
You're a cheeky kid.
Is that so, really?
This trick might end up hurting you, I know it.
You have to contradict me.
I'll make you be quiet. Hey, cheer up, my friends!
Don't saints have lips, and holy pilgrims too?
Oh, traveler, your lips are meant for praying.
Oh, my dear, let's kiss like we would hold hands.
They are praying; please grant it, or else their faith will turn to despair.
Saints do not move, even if you pray to them.
Don't move while I pray.
So, when I kiss you, my guilt is washed away.
Then my lips are guilty of the sin they have committed.
Are you sinning with your words?
Give me back my sin.
You kiss according to the rules.
Ma'am, your mother wants to talk to you.
Who is her mother?
I took care of her daughter that you were speaking to.
I'm telling you, whoever can catch her will get the money.
No, guys, don't get ready to leave.
We're just having a small, silly party. Is that okay?
I will go to bed now.
The argument is between our bosses and us, their employees.
It doesn't matter.
I will prove to be a tyrant.
Do the maids' heads?
Oh, the virginity of the young women, or their maidenhood.
Take it however you want.
They need to understand and feel it.
They will feel my wrath as long as I can stand, and everyone knows I'm quite the catch.
It's good that you're not a fish.
Pull out your weapon!
I have my weapon drawn.
Come here, nurse.
Who is that man over there?
The son and heir of the late Tiberio.
Who is that guy leaving the room?
Wow, I think you're quite the young one, Petruchio.
I don't know.
Go and ask him his name, and find out if he's married.
What is this?
What is this?
All the strangers have left.
Now Romeo is in love and loved in return, both enchanted by each other's looks. But he feels he must complain to his enemy, as she is stealing love from him.
She is just as in love, but she has much less opportunity to meet her new love anywhere.
Passion gives them strength, time allows them to meet, balancing extremes with extreme sweetness.
Can I move on when my heart is still here?
He is smart, and I swear he has gone home to bed.
He ran in this direction and jumped over that orchard wall.
"Hey, Mercutio, come here."
No, I'll summon as well!
Romeo, where art thou?
Show yourself as a sigh!
Just say one rhyme, and I'll be happy.
I cry out "oh no!" and say "love" and "dove." I'll talk to my friend Venus and give her son, young Cupid, a cute nickname. He shot true when King Cophetua loved the beggar maid. But he doesn't hear, move, or stir.
If he hears you, you will make him angry.
He can't be angered by this.
My request is sincere and honest.
His love is blind and is most suited to the darkness.
If love is blind, it can't hit the target.
Now he will sit under a medlar tree and wish his mistress were that kind of fruit that maids call medlars when they laugh alone. Oh Romeo, I wish she were that fruit!
Go, then, for it is futile to search for him here if he does not wish to be found.
Juliet is like the sun in the east.
Her pure white dress is only pale and sickly, and only fools would wear it.
Get rid of it!
She is my lady.
Oh, it's my love.
Oh, if only she knew who she really is!
She talks, but she doesn't say anything.
What about that?
She's talking with her eyes.
She's not speaking to me.
Two of the most beautiful stars in the sky are asking her eyes to sparkle while they are away.
Her gaze in the sky would shine so brightly that birds would sing and think it was not night.
Look at how she rests her cheek on her hand.
Oh, I wish I were a glove on that hand so I could touch that cheek!
Oh Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?
Why are you Romeo?
It's just your name that's my enemy.
From now on, I will never be Romeo.
Who are you, sneaking around in the dark and interrupting my thoughts?
I don't know how to tell you my name.
Are you not Romeo, and a Montague?
The orchard walls are tall and difficult to climb, and it's dangerous for you to be here, considering who you are. If any of my relatives find you here, it could mean trouble.
So, your relatives don't stand in my way.
If they see you, they will kill you.
Just act sweet, and I won't let their hostility affect me.
I wouldn't want them to see you here for anything.
I would rather die from their hatred than live without your love.
You know it's dark out, otherwise I'd be blushing at what I said tonight.
Do you love me?
I know you will say "yes," and I will trust you.
What should I swear by?
Don't swear at all.
Or, if you prefer, swear by yourself, which is the one I worship, and I'll believe you.
If you truly love me, then don't make any promises.
Even though I am happy with you, I am not happy about this agreement tonight.
This love that is just beginning may blossom into something beautiful when we see each other again in the summer.
May your heart find as much peace and rest as mine does.
Oh, are you going to leave me feeling unsatisfied like this?
What satisfaction can you have tonight?
The exchange of your faithful vow of love for mine.
I gave you mine before you asked for it, and I wish I could give it to you again.
Would you take it back?
Why do you love?
To be honest, I'll give it back to you.
But I only wish for what I already have.
My generosity is as endless as the sea, my love as deep.
I can hear some noise coming from inside.
Goodbye my dear love. See you soon, good nurse! Montague, be faithful.
Just stay a little while longer.
I will come back.
Oh, what a wonderful night!
I'm afraid that being in the dark makes me think that all of this is just a dream, too good to be true.
"Good night, Romeo, and three words, my dear."
Do not be afraid of me.
Let's make sure the law is on our side.
Let them start.
I'll scowl as I walk by, and let them interpret it however they want.
No, they will do it if they dare.
I'll insult them by biting my thumb, which will be a disgrace to them if they tolerate it.
Are you flipping us off, dude?
I'm biting my thumb at you, sir.
Are you flipping us off, dude?
Are you picking a fight, sir?
Are you trying to start a fight, sir?
No, sir.
I will send it tomorrow.
My soul thrives, good night a thousand times!
It's a thousand times worse to want your light.
My voice is hoarse from crying out in bondage, but if I could, I would scream so loudly that I would shatter the cave where echo resides and make her voice even hoarser than mine with the repeated cries of "my Romeo!" It is my soul that longs for my love.
At night, the sound of lovers' voices is as sweet as silver, like the most soothing music to those who are listening.
Romeo, where art thou?
What are you talking about?
What time tomorrow should I send a message to you?
By nine o'clock.
I won't fail.
It's twenty years until then.
I forgot why I called you back.
Let me wait here until you remember it.
I will still stay with you, even if you continue to forget, and I will forget any other place except for this one.
It's almost morning.
But no more than a playful bird, which allows itself to hop a little from his hand like a poor prisoner in his twisted chains, and then pulls it back with a silken thread, so lovingly possessive of its freedom.
I wish I were your bird.
I would also like that, my dear.
I could still love you to death.
Have a good night, sleep well!
Saying goodbye is bittersweet, but I'll see you again tomorrow.
Close your eyes and find peace within yourself.
I wish I could just sleep and find some peace, it's so sweet to rest.
So I will go to my priest's private room to ask for his help and share my good fortune with him.
The morning sun smiles on the dark night, creating streaks of light in the eastern clouds. The darkness staggers away like a drunkard as the day begins and the sun rises.
Before the sun rises, I need to fill our basket with poisonous weeds and valuable flowers to brighten the day and dry the night's damp dew.
The earth, which is nature's mother, is also her grave.
And from her womb, we find children of various kinds sucking on her natural bosom. Each child has their own unique virtues, but none are perfect and they are all different.
Oh, there is great power in the healing properties of herbs, plants, and stones.
There is nothing so disgusting that exists on the earth that doesn't also provide some special benefit to the earth.
Virtue can become vice when it's misused, and sometimes vice can seem noble through actions.
In the tiny bud of this flower, there is both poison and healing power.
Two opposing kings still reside within us, both in humans and in plants, representing grace and rudeness.
Wherever the bad is in charge, the deadly disease quickly destroys that plant.
Good morning, father.
Bless you.
Which language is greeting me so sweetly?
Young son, it shows a troubled mind to go to bed so early.
Worry is always present in the eyes of every old man, and where worry resides, sleep will never come.
But where a young person with a clear mind lies down to rest, peaceful sleep takes over.
So, your early awakening makes me think that you are disturbed by something.
If not, then I'm right: Romeo hasn't been in bed tonight.
The last statement is accurate.
I had a much better rest.
Do you mean with Rosaline, my spiritual father?
That's my great son.
Where have you been?
I'll tell you before you ask me again.
Both of our cures are found in your assistance and in the power of medicine.
I don't hate you, blessed man. In fact, my prayers also help my enemy.
