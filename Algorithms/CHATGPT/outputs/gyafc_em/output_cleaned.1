Of course it's Tom Cruise, what did you expect?
If he hadn't dumped Jennifer Aniston, I would've gone with Brad Pitt.
If you hit up the info line, they'll hook you up right away.
But, you could think of all three as being part of one big movie.
I'm positive it's gonna be Kellie, Katherine, Chris, and Ace.
I've got a couple of favorites, actually.
I just can't resist it!
I really like Tyra, but I think I gotta go with Angelina Jolie.
It's like a little movie, and super confusing.
I'm totally into hair metal like Motley Crue, Poison, Cinderella, Faster Pussycat, Slaughter, and all that good stuff.
If they were really a thing, it didn't stick around for very long.
I really love that show and I keep watching the re-runs.
My butt is already roasted. You're starting to smell really good.
She was like a role model for girls.
Are you a fan of theirs?
I was cool with '7th heaven,' but it just wasn't my thing.
I've got some vanilla ice and the new kids on the block.
She's not the greatest singer.
I like Jerry Springer better than David Letterman.
I'm into two of their songs, but the rest are just not my jam.
Who's the one singing 'i don't like the looks of it'?
Fifty cent is lookin' good with all those muscles.
I don't think this is cute at all. You should check out Ville Valo or Bam Margera if you want to see a hot guy.
Lin wrote the same thing I was trying to write.
Your mom is so dumb, she stuck a phone up her butt thinking she was making a "booty call".
I hope this doesn't fry your brain.
Why are all these guys dissing my girl?
I'm stoked to be checking out the Hershey factory tomorrow!
I know a bunch of other people who do it too.
Lynn is the funniest one.
There were two teams, one with brunettes and the other with blondes.
I think it's kind of tacky to say the actual name, but maybe I'll just call it "jet" instead.
Don't worry, it'll all work out in the end.
Your mom is so dumb, she'd probably put out the last bit of heat in your house.
I just need the name of the movie... thanks.
Hey, your name is already from Star Wars!
I really love that movie.
That's a really good question, though.
They're super cute.
I think one bottle of Captain Morgan will do the trick. I'm heading up north, can you meet me at the library?
The comic strips are always gonna be the bomb.
I don't know because I've never given it a shot.
It's like a really long comic, not a book.
The Beatles' tunes like 'Rubber Soul', 'Revolver', and 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'.
I don't trust anyone who doesn't like at least one Sublime song.
She's just a no-good person who profits off of other people's problems.
I reckon the third movie should be the end.
Yeah, I reckon I am. A lot of folks say the same thing.
They get Rizza, Jizza, and Ghost Face Killer. (Informal: They score Rizza, Jizza, and Ghost Face Killer.)
I can't believe they still show professional wrestling on TV, it's total garbage.
Why are they hitting me with a cane?
Check out the movie '9 & 1/2 weeks' because Mickey Rourke is seriously hot.
Hey, maybe we could be friends!
Does anyone else love the song "Breath Me" by Sia? I'm trying to find the lyrics.
I'm really into the songs 'the city sleeps' and 'if i only had a brain'.
I've never seen so many TV show DVDs at Best Buy.
I actually bought one, which is pretty funny.
What kind of animating do you do?
Some animals you might see are a chicken, hyena, and a jackal.
Sorry, I've never heard of it.
The kid was probably only six or seven years old.
If it's an old car, just roll the window down. If not, just unlock the door.
I think Abba was massive in the 80's and I reckon they still have a ton of fans.
Your mom is not very smart, she thought a lawsuit was something you wear to court.
Do you need two pounds of bricks?
I wanna watch Full House or Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.
They're usually about your personality, not your life decisions.
"Of course, it's gotta be the Red Hot Chili Peppers."
So, in Batman, when he was getting better, this blond dude took charge.
I'm into pretty much all kinds of rock music.
All he could hear was the person breathing.
Virgos usually have pretty outgoing personalities.
I think this question might be tricky, but I'll give it a shot and answer two.
I mean, I don't think I'm conceited or anything, but I know I'm pretty hot.
It's funny, but it's really dumb.
Slip some 'icyhot' or 'bengay' into his undies or rub it on his deodorant.
This question is weird, but I don't like either of them. However, Salvador Dali is definitely more talented.
He's gotta be a good guy 'cause he needs a real job with steady pay.
The doc was totally surprised and wanted to know what the heck I've been up to.
I think Beyonce is the best because she's younger and dances better.
The cops totally rocked out to 'everything she does is magic.'
There's this one called 'Doc Watson'.
Why didn't anyone bring up "Evil Dead"?
Just pretend like you know what you're doing and be assertive.
They're the sickest metal band.
They've got cords you can buy.
This is not like anything I've seen before, though.
I saw it just the other week.
