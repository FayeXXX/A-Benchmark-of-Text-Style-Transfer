Right on , now .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
And you're not changed ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
And we'll kill me .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I don't know what you're talking about .
The other just told you .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Yes , hurry , hurry , along with me , and I'll go home with you , as this one may be happy about your efforts , which may happen to hide your thoughts .
Oh , let us go .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
They run that then .
Where the devil should this be compassed ?
Wasn't he coming home tonight ?
Not to his father's house .
I spoke with his man .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Bloodshed will pay it .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Yes , he won't answer the priest , how he wants , being overjoyed .
Alas , poor Glou-cester !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
The what ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Good morning to you both .
What did I ask for you ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Can you imagine something ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
No better .
Well , sir .
You lie .
You don't know what you want .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
My name's Gloucester .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Was I with you there for the goose ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I can't fight you from the first for that question .
Yes , good ones , please .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
And is it completely stopped to be a sweet girl ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Now you're talking about it .
Now you're talking about it .
He's here whenever you have sold your own dinner .
Oh , you're absolutely right .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Here's my nephew .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Again !
My name's Roderigo , calm down .
God bless you , good gentlemen .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Is it good luck ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Get out !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Gentlemen , can any of you tell me where I may find the young idea ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Very well , it's what you've said , good madam .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
So ho !
What have you found ?
Yeah , will you come to your father's ?
We'll go to dinner , Jessica .
I won't follow you .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Wait !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I am tired of his favorites .
I saw no man at his shop to watch .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Wait !
Meanwhile , listen to me and your wife .
I wanted to see you , ma'am , and I won't tell her , I will tell her as much .
Lord , Lord , she will be a cruel woman .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
And stay , good advice .
Hurry !
Farewell .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Farewell .
Take me to your mistress .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Listen to me , sir .
What do you want to kill my dear niece ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Well , sir , my mistress is the sweetest , Lord , Lord , Lord !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Take me to your lady .
Yes , a thousand , cowardly , oh !
Again !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Maybe she can do him soon .
That's not necessary .
Oh , she is wonderful !
Meanwhile !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Oh God , she doesn't dare you , Oh , what news ?
Has it come with him ?
Send your man away .
Peter , stay at the gate .
Now , good sweet brother-in-law , Lord , why are you sad ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I would have my luck and I want your news .
Can you stay awhile ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
How are you out of breath when you're married to me that you'll say to me that I'm out of breath ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Is your news good , or bad ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Let me be satisfied .
Is that good or bad ?
Well , you have made a simple tongue .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Damn it !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Go your sword , sir .
Hello tonight .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
No , no .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
What does he think of our marriage ?
What of that ?
My back on a magic trip .
Ah , my back , my back !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Where is my mother ?
Why , she is moving .
Where should she be ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Oh , dear lady , don't you think so ?
Yes , come up , I swear .
Is this the job for my brother's sake ?
We're sorry for your troubles .
Here's such a stupid man .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I have .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
There isn't a husband to make a wife a wife .
Now that's the whole tree in your blood .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Listen to you .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Go .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Have at you , coward !
Conquer , crush , and wait !
Strike !
Don't go down !
Wake up with the wine !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
What noise is this ?
My sword , I say !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
He's villain to say this !
He's not ready to buy a single room to get a present .
Listen to my fortune !
Honest countrymen , farewell .
Amen , goodbye .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Don't love me .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Here comes the lady .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Come , come with me , and we will make short work .
I don't want to know what you're going to do .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
And what ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
The devil's Rosalind ?
Oh , unfaithful !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
By my habit , I don't care .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Could you expect some bodily party like that ?
Meanwhile , I'm leaving with you .
What , are you trying to make us weep ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I won't just take any man's second-hand goods .
Well , peace be with you , sir .
Here comes my man .
But I'll be able to swear if he were your proxy .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
You're right for me .
Don't talk to me .
I see you're not fully out of you .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Don't turn out and listen .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Oh , calm , vile , scoundrel !
What does she have to tell me ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I am for you .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Hurry , hurry .
I want to hurt .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I am
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
What , you're not hurt ?
Yes , it's enough .
Where is my servant , Please , good-bye , get a liar !
Hello , man .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Ask me for tomorrow , and you shall find me a fool's cap .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Why are the men waiting for you ?
I was told your song .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Help me into some house , or I couldn't , it'll be .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
They have made fun of me .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Your bedroom !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Here comes the smartest working-man back again .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Either you or I , both , I'd go with him .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
We're just alive .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Why are you coming ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Speak , ma'am .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Where are the branches
Oh , noble prince , I can discover all the rumors of this horrible hill .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Listen , my cousin !
Oh , my brother's child !
Oh , cousin , cousin !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Hurry , let's die immediately , do your friends !
Friends , part !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
And , as he fell , will turn and fly away .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
He speaks about it .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Separate them .
Listen to me soon .
Arrest him : he agrees , I'll fight .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Other women have to kill those who kill you .
Please do .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Come on , gentlemen .
Come on , shovel .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Yes , ma'am , the jeweler .
Yes , what are you done ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Ah , oh !
We are tired , lady , we are undone !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Can God be so crazy ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I'm going to be there .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Oh , hello , the best thing I had !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Is Marcus Luccicos , and is my father dead ?
My dearest relative , my sweet lord ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
It did , it did .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Silly babbler , how dare you !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Ah , where's my wife ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
On his position !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
But why , Nature , don't you kill my cousin ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
All this is good .
What's going on , then ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Everything is dead , and it's dead !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Will you go to them ?
I won't bring you room .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
And death , don't be ashamed , my master's queen !
Listen to your tomb .
I'll find everything to comfort you .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Hurry , hurry up .
Come on , you're one man .
Father , what news ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I bring you proof of the dialogue .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Ha , ha !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Be patient , for the world is wide and ladylike .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Everything !
Oh , unfaithful !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Everything may do this , but I must take this fly .
They are free people , but I am unfaithful .
And don't you know that I'm saying about the death ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Everything about it .
How are you ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Oh , where is that ?
Don't you see him today ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Talk no more .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Let me tell you of your situation .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Really , I guess .
Certainly .
You're naughty .
Good idea , let's hide .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Who doesn't appear so ?
Aren't you coming ?
What's your will ?
Oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , how silly is my nephew ?
Where's Seleucus ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Oh , it's busy , oh !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Good-bye , you can be a man .
For Falstaff , for her sake , don't stand up and stand .
Why should you fall into so deep a sin ?
Damn it !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Companions .
Aren't you out of here ?
How is it with her ?
Where is she ?
And how did she get ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
You're a man ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
What , don't wish me like that !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Everything is coming .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Oh , what stuff !
Do so , and tell me to finish my advice .
Here , sir , a ring she gave me , please you .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Go ahead .
Good night .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Give me your hand .
It's late .
Farewell .
They're all welcome , sir , so we have to say that we had no time to move our daughter .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Well , we were born to die .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Madam , good night .
Take me to your daughter .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
What day is this ?
Good-bye , my lord .
Let's go !
Ha , ha .
Do you like this play ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
But what do you say to tempt me ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Snip !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Don't stay yet .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Let me be cheerful .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I have more care to stay than to go .
Come on , death and welcome !
Let's go .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
It is , it is .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
More light and light , more dark and nasty !
Madam .
Understand ?
Your lady is coming to your uncle's house .
The day is approaching .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Farewell , farewell .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
My noble uncle , do you know the cause ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Have you seen him by any means ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Farewell !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Oh , what's going to get there again ?
Oh God , I have an incomparable girl .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Goodbye , goodbye !
Oh , fortune , fortune !
All men call you seriously .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Is it my mother ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Why , how did you say that ?
Madam , I don't know you .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
What , will you accompany him from his grave with tears ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Don't have to work .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Right so the loss is the crime , but you'll keep anything the same .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
What villain , madam ?
That same villain , please .
That is because the traitor himself lives .
Yes , madam , from the roof of these battles .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
And then , I hope you're going to be satisfied .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
But now I'll tell you privately , restrain yourself .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
What are they doing , your highness ?
Well , well , you're a careful father , child .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Yes , yes .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I don't know what you want to know and father , my lord , I can't marry her. .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Here comes your father .
Tell him so yourself , and see how he will take it at your hands .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
How will she get one ?
Is she really being angry ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
How are you , how , how ?
Halt !
What is this ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Get up , you measly , lying candle !
Get out , you dark-skinned gypsy !
You kill me !
Stop , oh !
What , are you crazy ?
Good Father , I beg you on my hand , Please tell me to speak but with a word .
We're not waiting for a single man .
Definitely not .
Don't answer me .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
God in heaven bless her !
You are to blame , my lord , to blame her so .
And why , my Lady Grey ?
You're with your master , goodbye .
I speak no treason .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
May only one speak ?
Quiet , you stupid fool !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
You are too hot .
God's bedroom !
It makes me crazy .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Lay away in order , please .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Listen to that , you half-blood .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Talk not to me , for I'll speak a word .
Do as I can , for I have done with you .
Oh God !
My husband is on earth , my sword in heaven .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
They're coming .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Some point , please .
Oh , he's a poor gentleman .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Fast !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Aren't you from your heart ?
Amen !
What ?
Well , you've been frowning very much to me .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Yes , I will , and this is wisely .
Oh , how wicked !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
If all else happens , I have power to die .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
The time is very valuable .
You say you don't know the whole way now .
I like it completely .
Now do you know the reason of this forest .
Look , sir , here comes the lady toward my cell .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
That may be , sir , when I won't be a wife .
Good luck , cousin .
Is the day so young ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Was that my father that went down so fast ?
It was .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
In love ?
Get out .
Of love ?
Where shall we get married , sir ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
That's a certain attitude .
Come you to make fun of this contract ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I won't pretend to you that I love him .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Your face is mine , and I'm not dreaming .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
God pardon me !
Oh , I didn't know your grief .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Listen to me .
Barnardo's over this morning .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Let me stay with the devil back in your bedroom .
No problem , no doubt I've got it back to you .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Farewell , dear lady .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
How can I think you don't ?
Don't say that he's carried away his position with me .
Go , hurry .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Yes , yes .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Go tell him about this .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
This is healthy .
Stand up .
Yes , please , go ahead , and say I won't get him , and , please God , this noble blood !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Niece , will you go with me to help me to watch my cave instead of answering you , as you ordered me to steal tomorrow ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
There is time enough .
We'll go to supper tomorrow .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Go to you , help me to stand up .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Let me alone .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
What , are you getting up , mister ?
Aren't you my fool ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Good night .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
My thanes , Athens must not live until I act alone .
Come on , shovel .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Shall I be married tomorrow tomorrow morning ?
You're lying there .
Oh , look !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Stay , listen , stay !
Hurry , crush , go !
Here's another .
I drink to you .
No , please , I don't bite myself .
Good heart , what did you think ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
A snake is a fickle son , a tumor digesting a bloodline .
Farewell , my dear lord .
Hello !
I won't go inside .
And if you leave me so , you do me wrong .
Tut , I have lost myself .
I don't like that .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Damn it !
Why , no .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Come , Ariel , you're damned , farewell !
The second Macbeth has happened .
The friar's ready to start the marketplace .
Don't take the evidence for the money .
Go ahead , you need to go .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Now , tell me what is there ?
Make haste , please make us make fun .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
A good messenger , ha !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Halt !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Go ahead .
Go and get her up .
I'll go and join with you .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Make me sleep , I say .
Mistress !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Hey !
Why , lady !
Why , love , I say .
Madam !
Horny animals !
Why , help me !
What , not a word ?
You take your chances now .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Yes , let the job take you in your bed .
He'll be able to see you up , sir .
Will it be ?
What noise is here ?
Oh , everyone !
What is the matter ?
Look , look .
Oh , help !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
My child , my only life , oh , look up , or I will die with you ! , Help , help !
For shame , bring out the storm .
Her lord is getting up .
She's dead , she's a traitor .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
That's the day .
She's dead , she's dead , she's dead !
Ha ?
Let me see her .
Get out , insolent eunuch !
She's calm .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Oh , everyone !
Oh , it's time .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Come , is the Queen ready to go to church ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Death is my heir .
My daughter has also been serious .
I will die , because I'm free of all .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Oh , help !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Oh , Macbeth , oh , oh !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Oh , love !
Oh , life !
Not life , but love in death .
Instead , she's a traitor , she's killed , killed !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
My soul , and my child !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Quiet , quiet , for shame !
Everything !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Wait , we may put up our heads and be gone .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
It's no time to play now .
You can't do it ?
No .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
What will you give us ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I will give you the message .
Then I will give you the restful catch .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Yes , sir , because you've ruined a single tale .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Wait , I know what to say about .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Hang him , Titinius !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Ah !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
How does my lady say ?
Is my father well ?
How are my slippers ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Then she is well , and nothing can be bad .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Oh , pardon me for taking news for you , my master , for you did leave it , my lord .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
In Spain , cousin , I do love a woman .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
She'll think about her .
Oh , that's how I beg you to think about that !
Is it feasible ?
Then I won't mention you , then !
I've heard my lot .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I will go tonight .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Wait , I'm going to Fife .
Leave me and do the same thing I can .
Has he come to hear me from the bridge ?
No , my good lord .
No matter .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I'll be with you straight .
Well , sir , I will lie with you tonight .
Let's see for all .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
As I remember , this should be the house .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Damn it !
Who calls so coldly ?
Come here , man .
I see that you're poor .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
You're in your own mood .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Otherwise , hurry .
That's why she's cheated !
Brother , hey !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
What does that mean ?
Or , if his mind is back , give me his letter .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Who takes my face here , then , to wash ?
Nonsense !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
But I won't agree to bed again , and keep her at my tent until you're bothering me .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Give me your iron servant , sir .
You're a traveler , and hurry .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Give me those hundred .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Whatever I will .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
What a farce !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I won't be married , sir , and don't trouble yourself .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Take that you .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Get up and leave me .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Let them come immediately .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Oh , be quiet !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Didn't I pay you ?
Then have at you , boy !
Oh , Lord of them !
I will go call the watch .
Open the tomb .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
What did you think , my lord , when I could not go around as we have ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Aren't he dead ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Oh , no .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I'm not quite sane .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Oh , here I will set up my rest , and let's shake the teeth of heaven and throw this terrible evidence of this blood .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Meanwhile , take your last room .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
These !
You're a traitor. !
How does Lysander work with my old master !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
As I vowed , I'm not interested in the mud by her bedroom .
Who is it ?
Good-bye .
How long has he been there ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Go with me to the duel .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Stay , then .
I'll go alone .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Hurry !
Oh , lying !
Where is my lord ?
I don't remember anything well , because I should be there .
Where is my nation ?
I hear some noise .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Come on , come away .
Your husband in your arms lies now , and that's too bad .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I will kiss your lips .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Me , really ?
Then I'll be brief .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
This is the place .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Hey !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Run to the ambassadors .
Pick up the corpses .
Some others have arrived .
Here's another man .
We found him in the goblet .
Listen to him until the Prince falls here .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
A great message .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Oh , help !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Oh , me !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Alas , my lord , my sister is dead tonight .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Please stand up .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Then say at once what you're thinking about this in the forest .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
What can he say in this ?
Their forces of love , the enemy of her death .
Damn it !
Oh , brother , give me your hand .
But now , my lord , what do you say to my suit ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
My child is finally a stranger in the world .
She has only seen the change of the deep years .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
And too soon I've got one of those things .
But woo her , gentle brother , get her heart .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
The table !
Women .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Go , coward , let's see about this simple mood .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Your logic is getting worse for that .
For what , I don't like anything ?
Why , what's going on , mister ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
God bless you , good evening .
I don't know , sir , can you get it ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Perhaps you have ruined it without complaining .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Yes , if I know the letters and the language .
What did happen .
Stay , ma'am .
I can read that .
Sometimes
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Aren't they going to come ?
Up .
Who's calling me ?
To supper ?
To our house .
Whose house ?
My master's decision .
Indeed , I should have given you that before .
Now I'll tell you without asking .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Everything you mean !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
You're talking about my own sister ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I'll go along with this man's own mind , even to try to rejoice in this man's own poisoned .
Hello , where's my daughter ?
Call her back to me .
Now , by my opinion , at twelve months I do like her .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
How did that , sweetheart ?
Your mother .
Madam , I am here .
What is your will ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
She's not feeling well .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Lunatics , and God , God rest her life ! , It's only a big deal .
Well , it's with you .
She was too good for me .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Yes , I remember it well .
It's obvious .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
My lord and you were at it .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Only no need to worry , I won't let me guide you .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I don't want to make you happy .
Yes , madam .
Whatever I can choose .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
It is an honor that I just heard of .
Well , think about marriage now .
Meanwhile , since you are loyal , gentlemen of kindness , or I'll wear you .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
A man , young lady !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
What do you say ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I must go to school .
I beg you , follow him .
We follow me , ma'am , the war's over .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
What , you'll have this money for our excuse ?
Or else we won't get such stuff ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
But let them go separate ways , or they will .
Give me a tip .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Yes , yes , let's go back to you .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
You are a lover .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
But you're not planning to meet you so soon .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Come on , we burn men , then !
Yes , that's just so .
We waste our armies in honey , like birds do before the fire .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Why , wouldn't one ask ?
I recognize a dream tonight .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Well , what was yours ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Everything is done , and we won't come too late .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Find up , ma'am .
Where's that , he wouldn't want to take away ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Yes , boy , I'm ready .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
We can not be here and there too .
Goodbye , boys .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Welcome , gentlemen !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
It's more , it's more .
His son is Lucentio , sir .
His son is approaching .
Will you tell me that ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I don't know , sir .
Oh , she doesn't have the freedom to get ashore !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
What's going on here ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Goodbye , please , my gentle lord .
Let him alone .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I would not for the wealth of all the town today , my king has rewarded him .
Don't be patient .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
You'll not believe him !
Why , uncle , it's a shame .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
You are a crab-apple here .
Is that why , Horatio ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
You must go drown me .
I'll make you treat me like a tyrant. , my liege !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Oh , then , dear God , let them do whatever I mean .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
We're not planning to make orders for money , for God .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Give me my robe again .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
What is her mother ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I'll give up my thoughts .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I will show myself a tyrant .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Take it in what sense you've said .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Draw your gown !
My sword is getting out .
Come here , ma'am .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
What's happening now , here ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I don't know .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
What's this ?
What's this ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Now , good-bye !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Can I go hide when my heart is here ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Yes , I'll challenge it !
Damn it !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Maybe !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
My eyesight has always been honest .
Fruits and vegetables don't like his love and the dark .
If love is so bad , don't accept such a mark .
Now , Kate !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Eighty ducats !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Oh , it is my love .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
What of that ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Her eye !
See how she rubs her foot like her hand .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Oh , that's what !
What's going on , mister ?
It's just your name that is my enemy .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
You're not going to make a mockery of you ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Didn't you love me ?
I know what you've said to say , because I will get your word .
What can I swear by ?
Don't worry at all .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
If my dear heart's going , love , do not swear .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Oh , can you leave me so easily ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Can't God try to cry ?
For what I'm leaving , then ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
And yet I wish I should have the thing I need .
My highness is as clear as the sea , not as deep as my wounds .
I hear some noise .
Dear love , please , good Meg , good Meg , be brave , I'm true .
Stay just a little .
I won't come again .
Oh , blessed night !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Everything's fine , my good friend , and good night .
That's me .
Let us take the law of our swords .
Let them go .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Yes , as they planned .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I don't want to recognize my father .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Do you want to play , sir ?
Hello , sir ?
No , sir .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Really , it's okay .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Damn it !
My darling ?
What tomorrow will I send to you ?
By the hour of nine years .
I can't trust you .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Let me stand here until you remember it .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
It's almost morning .
And yet .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Good night , good night !
Actually , it's true : I won't say good luck till it be morning .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Good morning , General .
Okay .
What two years will be sad for me ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
That last is true .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
That's my good son .
But where are you been , then ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I don't expect any commerce , but if he won't pay for my wife , my dear Bianca .
A halter gratis , a little means and sufferance .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I'll tell you more further than that , where we are found and well , where we are in love , how now we part but now , Come hither , sir , to marry us today .
Whate'er thou art , this is a glove of virtue !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Then young men love their eyes , with their hearts ' hearts .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
There's not a dream upon your lap , A hard eye doth draw thee thus near him .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
And now thou hast thou been ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Pray you , I beseech you , pardon me .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
But come on , young man , come with me , sir .
Fortune , get thee out .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Where the devil can not be ?
Didst thou not meet him last night ?
Not to his father's house .
I am a knave .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I warrant a challenge .
Yearly will I answer the challenge .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Good morrow to you both .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Dost thou understand what thou art saying ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Well then .
You lie .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
What ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Thou hast this warlike isle of Egypt .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
You have more wild years in one of your daughters than I have in one of mine .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Now be thou jocund .
Now be thou jocund .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I would have made it short .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Here's something good .
There's two , a man and a woman .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Be at your service .
Give me my robe , Saint Jeronimy .
Good morrow , masters .
Good morrow , fair lady .
Is it possible ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
The breaking of Cassio !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Thou art a man , my lady , that hath made for himself to ruin .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Sirrah , wilt thou hold of me , where I can not choose ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
You speak well .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Thou found it out .
What have you found out ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Trouble us no further .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I shall see thee hanged for thy own burden .
If I had seen nothing like that , I would quickly have bought my beard .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Sirrah , give my regards to your lady .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Lord , Lord , she'll be a happy woman .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Adieu .
Be honest and good , and I'll salute you for your Grace .
Adieu .
I'll commend my daughter to your mistress .
May heaven in heaven bless thee .
Now fare you well , sir .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I assure you , my man is as true as steel .
Well , sir , my mistress is the sweetest lady .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
But when I say so , I swear she is as clear as a dream .
Do not , madam , what of that ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Ay , a thousand times .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Thou livest .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Perchance she will not find him .
That will not be .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
O sweet counsel , what news do you bring ?
Have you not spoken to him ?
Send your man away .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Now , good sweet coz , Lord , why do you look so sad ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I am undone .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I wish you had my bones , and I had your news .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Do not you see that I'm out of breath ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Is the news good or bad ?
Answer that question .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Tell me so I can be satisfied .
Is it good or bad ?
Well , you have made a foolish name .
You know not how to be a Roman .
Whither ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Be good .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
No , I have had none .
Pronounce you with money I told you nothing .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
What manner of law ?
My head is lock'd .
My affections too , too !
Believe me , thou hast changed in thy pain .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Where is my mother ?
Why , she's gone .
Where else would she be ?
Your answer is so strange !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Are you this "gamut" ?
Come , thou art a mocker !
Is this the cure for my humor of fortune ?
From now on , take heed of thy bones .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Come , what did he say ?
Do you have friends to go out and take 'em today ?
I do .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Now I see the blood o ' th ' air .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Go to the church .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Go .
I'll go to thee .
You go to fetch my bosom .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
What ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Use thy plainness and thy scars !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Beat them !
Down with the topmast !
Down with the topmast !
Wherefore is this ?
I am my sword .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Avaunt , thou villain !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Fare thee well , nymph .
Amen , amen .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
That is the key o ' love .
Too fast is as bad as too black .
Here comes the lady .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Farewell , how affable and vile .
Yearly will I thank you , my lord , for both of us .
I'll give him thanks , so they are not .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Come , come with me , and the same We shall give thee .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Am I not one of those unhappy wars ?
Come , you can not be as angry as any fellow in Italy when you're in the mood .
And what of that ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Twas you would look for a fight like that .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Your life ?
That's good .
O great lord , here come the key .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Set it along with something else .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
You'll find me enough to do 't , sir , if you give me a reason .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Faith , you hang out with torches .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Out o ' land , sir .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I will content thee to fear .
Well , may peace be with you .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
He's not your man .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I am no villain .
So , adieu .
I can not tell you that I am not .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Will you withdraw me into thy sword of "ifs" ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I'll fight thee .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Thou hast railed on thyself .
May a plague upon your generals .
Thou speak'st aright .
Did he not go away ?
What , are you hurt ?
But 'tis enough .
Where is my office ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
For for me tomorrow , and you'll find me in a grave .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I thought it was the right thing to do .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Twas to bear This food upon you .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Here comes the ancient wrestler back again .
He's dead and self-covered , and thou diest ?
Either you , or I , or both of us have go to fetch him .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Ho , get thee out of here .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
The Prince will give you the death if you give thee bail .
So get out of here !
Why dost thou spit ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Speak , gentle heavens .
Were you here when it came ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
He killed your brave knave , brave and then , young Kate killed him .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
He was my brother's son !
O cousin , cousin !
Peace. , Who comes with this heavenly battle ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Stand far away when thou liest .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Thou canst not hear the truth .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
You , Prince , are the man who can give me justice .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Far must die .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Who should now pay the price for aught of life ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Be comforted in thy snores .
I'll not assure thee so above that you'll be ashamed of this foul business .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Take away this body , and do what I say .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Come , prepare .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Ay , lady , this is the soldier's blow .
O my lord , what's the news ?
Why do you look so pale ?
He's dead .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
This is as blessed as the likes of hell .
Hast thou slain me ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I wish I had not lived long enough to see him die .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Temperance was my dearest cousin .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
It did , it did not .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Did a Dian ever hide in such a fair degree ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
O nature , what were you in here in hell ?
Was there ever such an evil woman with such a fair accusation ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Shame on thee !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
He was not born to be undone .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Oh , I was such a bird to be angry at him .
Are you not good ?
But wherefore , you villain , did you kill my cousin ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
All this is harsh enough .
Why , then , should I cry ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
That foul skin is worse than the devil of ten thousand ducats .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Where are my father and my mother , coz ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Are you not going to hasten them ?
I'll bring you there .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Go to thy house .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I know where he is .
Hark , your imprisonment will be here tonight .
I'll go to him .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Masters , come forth .
Come , you deceive me .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
You know too much about your Highness .
I have news for you of the selfsame tenor .
Is the mighty majesty of this far words ?
Ha , where's her ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Grim death !
O most pernicious woman !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
And yet you say that is not honesty That ever ?
Did you not have no poison , no longer , that no instrument could I use to kill me quickly , No more , nor clipped ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
O gull , where's the Sexton ?
Have you not seen him today ?
Thus he is not here for this fight .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
How should we hear , if wise men must not see ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
You shall not talk so well That you do not .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Use lenity , good Monsieur Melancholy .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Why dost thou sound so hard ?
Where do you come from ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Where's satisfaction ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Oh thou pernicious caitiff !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Stand , if thou art a man .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Why should you fall so into a thought ?
Holla !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Well , death is the end for the maids .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
How is she ?
Where is she ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
What does my wife say about our noble grace ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Tell me , sirs , what in my part of my body is my name ?
Tell me , so I can not cut it out of myself .
Are you a man ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Abide within .

And 'tis good to have such a joy in such a time .

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Some kind of treachery ?
Why are you still drawn ?
Have you not told her so ?
I wish the fool were dead and married to her ear !
How can this be ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
But I am weary that you have found it .
What is this ?

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
You talk , you rogue , no more !
You worthless swain !
You pale face !
Bless thee !
What , are you mad ?
Good father , thou canst not be honest , And thou shalt be damned and say not one thing .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Therefore you talk not .
She replied , the foul fiend vexes !
God in heaven bless thee !

And why , wise lady ?
Go with your Lordship to your friends .

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
She's not so late for this .
She's dead , like a fair flower , In an empty man's main .
O brave day !
Oh , this is a sore day !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Death is my office .
Death is my heir .
My daughter watches .
I will die and leave thy followers .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Yare , lower , O murderous , heavenly day !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
O vassal !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
There hath never been so black as a day as today .
Oh heavens , behold , woe is day !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
O love !
O life !
There is no life , but my love is dead !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
You are dead !
Be quiet , for shame !
The cure of mirth and woe is not That .
You had this child with the help of heaven .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
She is in a better place .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Thither instantly to this fair purpose of her grave .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Well , we will put away our dagger and go home .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
No , not a sad song .
Tis not the right time to play .
You shall , then ?
No .
Then shall I give it to you .

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
O my follies !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Do you have news from thee !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
How is my wife ?
Is my father well ?
How is my dearest ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Then she is well , and nothing is done .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I saw her buried in her closet , and then I came hither to tell you the news .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Tut , cousin , I love a woman .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
The woman I love is fair .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Well , thou art not on her company .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Take my office .
Do not so .
Teach me to forget , and that !
Is it not true ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
You know where I live .
Get me some ink and paper , And burn some hundred instruments .
I will leave here for Cyprus tonight .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Leave me and do what I told you to do .
Do not you have a letter for me from the exchange ?
No , my good lord .
No matter .
Get you on your hand And bring these horses .
I'll be with thee right away .
Well , alas , I'll lie with you tonight .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
As I remember , this should be the house .
Maintain a train , That the dead hath set out .
Affection !
Hoo !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Come hither , man .
I see 't you are poor .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
The world shall make thee make good counsel .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Alack , alack !
Brother , ho !
That voice is the word of Don John .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
What sayest thou now ?
Or , if he came down his bed , give him his letter .
I shall go to thee And I was borne there .
Then who took my arm thus ?
Despair !
Brother , I'll go and bring it to you .
Now I must go to the tomb of Antony .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
But I'll write again to my consent , And I'll keep her in my cabin until suppertime comes .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Away , away and hear me speak .
Put the curtains out so , I will not fail .
Give me those words .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Go .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Give me that bride and the movables .
I'll go , sir , and I warrant you .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Take this .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Stand away from hence and leave .
Think of the players That have died .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Hear me , young man , make me merry .
O , go away !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Nay , let's fight , boy !
O Lord , they are 'scaped !
I'll go call the watch .
Unwilling , I will .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
What says my man ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Or was I purposed ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
A grave ?
O no !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
You have been nobly borne .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
O , I'll rest here forever .
Masters , look upon the last time !
Zounds , make your offer too great !
His villainy grows further .
So I die with a kiss .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Saint Valentine , help me !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
God bless thee !
Tell me , my good friend , what is that light of light there ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Who is it ?
Fare-well .
How long hath he been there ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Go with me to the monument .
I dare not , sir .
Stay , then .
I'll go alone .
Thus it will be .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
O valiant cousin !
Where is my husband ?
I remember very well When I should be here , and I am .
Where is my nation ?
I hear some noise .
Lady , come out of the tomb .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Come , come away .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Thither , I see , has been the cause of his death .
I will kiss your lips .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Oh , noise ?
Then I'll be quick .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Pluck up my body and let me die .
This is the place .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
The ground is bloody .
This is a pitiful sight !
Go , tell the Prince .
Run to the present .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Here's sport .
We found him in the pit .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Very well .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
What's the matter , that they cry out so loud ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Perchance that this foul fiend follows me .
O heavens !
O wife , how fares our general ' daughter !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
O my follies !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
O my lord , my wife died tonight .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
What further woes must I in such old age ?
Look , and you'll see .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
In the meantime , hold on , and be patient .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I have already slept and envied thy prayers .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
In the meantime I wrote to cope him and told him to come forth this day To kiss her from her gentle grave From the empty eye From sleeping empty veins .
I know all of this .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Give me the letter .
O , brother , give me your hand .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I can not wish what I have said .
My daughter is still most honest .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Come along with me .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
For when you have gained your knowledge .
What ?
Home , art thou mad ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Hear me , sir , do you know how to read ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Perhaps thou dost hear from life and not from banishment .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Ay , if I know the language and the letters .
I see .
Well , that's an inch , fellow .
I can not read .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Where are they to come ?
Up .
Where ?
To supper ?
To our house .
Whose house ?
My master's daughter .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Now I'll tell you so you are not to entreat .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Have a goodly day !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
A woman more beautiful Than the one I love ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I'll go with you .
Yea , where's my daughter ?
Bid her come to me .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Come on !
Whither ?
Your mother .
Madam , be here .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
You know how young my daughter is .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
She was too good for me .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Nay , she will .
Indeed , I remember it well .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
You'll speak of this .
Prithee , be quiet .
Ay , madam .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
It was a delicate wench , and she was drawn by her .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
May 't please you To receive his grace .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Tell me , my daughter , what is your art , what of your getting ?
It is an honor that I do not dream of .
Well , fie upon thyself , friend .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
What a man , young lady .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Out of thy spirits .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
We'll follow you .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Or should we enter without apparel ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Give me a halter .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
No , noble signior , thou hast disposed to rest .
Not me , believe me .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
We shall take their heels .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Twere to run away .
You must stand and fight .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Come , lay thy throats on the boat .
Fortune !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Why , may I ask ?
I had a dream last night .
So did I .
Well , what was your dream ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Zounds , be quiet .
The wind doth not come near us ; our minds be remembered .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Beat the drum .
Where's satisfaction ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Take away the horologe , the tragedians , and the remainder .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Ay , boy , be ready .
Thou 'rt looking for the great emperor .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Welcome , gentlemen .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Welcome , gentlemen .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Are you not then to tell me that ?
His son was a farmer's eldest master , nor I .
I know not , sir .
Oh , she shows the wind how to th ' confusion !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I can tell by his voice that this man is a marvelously good-looking man .
Why dost thou so daff me ?
Uncle , this man is a vent of our enemy .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Fear him , that villain .
Sit , gentle cousin .
Leave him alone .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
So soft .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I will fetch him .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Go , go on .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Is that how it is , indeed ?
I know what I'll do .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I'll teach thee a present .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Give me my robe .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Who is her mother ?
I noted her daughter , whom you were not wont to answer .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Most certain .
The fight of our fellows , and we men work for 't .
Tis all the same .
I'll be a merry villain to them .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Temperance knows not a sweet sense of flesh .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
One inch of your mouth now .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Come hither , sirrah .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
He is the son and heir of old age .
Doth the villain o ' th ' earth ?
Well , that one , I think , is young indeed .
I know his name .
Go ask .
What's this ?
What's this ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Call to him , officer .
I'll neigh as if I were a spirit of a bachelor .
Hoo !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
What was thy fear of him .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
His love is so dull , it is in the dark .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Now he'll sit i ' th ' midst .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Let it go .
O , there's my lady !
Oh , it is my love .
Oh , I wish she knew how much I love her heartily .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
So what ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Look how she rubs her hand on her cheek .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
O my follies !
Who are you ?
I hate my name , dear lord , And my name is your enemy .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
And art thou a fellow ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
And wherefore did you come ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
If they see you , they'll murder you .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Do you love me ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
What should I swear by ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Masters , give me joy , I will not take joy in this discord of life .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
O , art thou so hasty to me ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Yet I wish I could take that promise , so I had it to give again .
You would take it back ?
Why would you do that , my love ?
Only to be ill and give it to thee once more .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Stay here for a moment .
I'll come back .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Do not torment me .
I will not break the law by a fight .
Let them go justly .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
You mean they might not .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Woo't thou fight ?
No , sir .
Tomorrow I'll send the messenger .
My soul depends on it , A thousand times good night .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Hoo !
My letters ?
What time tomorrow should I send a messenger to you ?
By nine o'clock .
I will translate .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
My sweet love , so do I .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Good night , good night .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Now shall I go , my lord , To give his help and tell him my good news .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
There is nothing on 't , that is thus so terrible that we can not play the cruel trick with some sufficient fellow .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Good morrow , father .
God bless you .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Therefore , the worm of law doth know this taper Hath cost me some sway .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
That's not my kind , boy .
But where have you been ?
I'll tell you before you have spoke to me again .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
