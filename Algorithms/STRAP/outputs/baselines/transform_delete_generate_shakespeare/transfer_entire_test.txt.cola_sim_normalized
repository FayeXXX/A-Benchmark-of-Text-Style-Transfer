more rich in fact than in words , brags of his substance , of ornament .
come on , come with me , and we will be short .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
am i such a fellow ?
come , come , thou art as hot as a jack in mood as any in italy , and as soon to be moved .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
yes , an there were two such things , we should have , for one would kill the other .
yes , why , wilt thou quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast .
thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts , having no other reason than because thou hast hazel .
what eye but such an eye would spy on such an eye ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
didst thou fall out like a tailor for wearing his new doublet before easter ?
who , tying his new shoes with old ribbon ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
what about the fee ?
simple enough !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
my heel , i care not .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
can you take some occasion without giving ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
what , could you make us minstrels ?
an hour or two ago , look to hear nothing but discords .
we all go in the public haunt of men .
withdraw unto private place , and explain of your grievances , or else depart .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i will for no man ' s pleasure , i swear .
yes , peace be with you , sir .
here comes my man again .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
therefore , goodbye .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
come on , turn and draw .
and yes , good capulet , which name i tender as dearly as my own , too .
dishonourable , vile submission !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher so the ears can hear ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i thank you for coming .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
come here , tybalt .
i am .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i sped up .

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
goodbye , man .
the hurt could be much worse .
no , don ' t be so deep as a well nor so wide as a - door , but don ' t serve .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
what a dog , a rat , a mouse , a mouse , a cat scratch a man to death !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
why did the devil send you to us ?
i was just under your arm .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
leave me some house , benvolio , or i shall .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i have it , and so do you .
oh , your majesty !
oh , romeo , romeo , brave mercutio is coming !
here comes the furious tybalt back again .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
this shall do that .
oh , romeo , gone , gone !
the citizens are ready , and tybalt is coming .
stand still .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
please , be gone , please !
why did you stay ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
there , that tybalt .
goodbye , nephew .
what were you doing when it happened ?
what are the vile beginners doing about this fray ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
oh , tybalt , my cousin !
my brother ' s coming !
oh , cousin !
benvolio , who killed this bloody fray ?
oh , romeo , he says aloud , hold , friends !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
this is the truth , benvolio , die .
he does not lie .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
no , romeo must not .
slew him because he slew mercutio .
what does the price of his dear blood owe ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i will listen to pleading and excuses .
nor tears nor tears shall buy out abuses , use .
bear this and attend to our will .
but murders like pardoning those that kill .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
yes , good night .
goodbye , romeo .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
the cords that bid fetch ?
ay , ay , the whole thing .

why dost thou wring hands ?
oh , welladay !
we are undone , lady , we are undone !
alack , get out of the way !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
what devil art thou that keeps me thus ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
what did romeo do ?
say but " ay , " and that bare vowel sounds just like the - darting of cockatrice .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
go to prison , please , ne ' er look on .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
tybalt , tybalt , the best thing i ever had !
that i should live to see you die .
where is romeo , and is tybalt coming ?
where is my dearest and my lord ?
tybalt is coming , and romeo .
god help me , romeo ' s hand is tybalt ' s blood ?

the next day , it happens .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
oh , dove dove , wolvish wolvish ravening lamb !

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
come on , where ' s my man ? , give me some aqua vitae . , give me some aqua vitae . , give me some aqua vitae .

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
he was going to shame me .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
why , villain , didst thou kill my cousin ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
this is comfort .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
tybalt is dead , and romeo is .

tybalt ' s name was woe enough , it had to be there .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
romeo is dead . there is no end , no limit , bind , bound , in that word ' s name .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
where is my father and my mother , then ?

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
oh , banishment !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

there is no world verona walls , purgatory , or hell itself .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
oh , deadly sin !
o , unthankfulness !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
they are all free men , but i am .
and sayst that exile is not dying ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
attends to it .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i want to part them all .

please , tell me , friar , tell me , in what part of this anatomy doth my lodge ?
tell me , that i could sack the hateful mansion .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
acts denote the wrath of a beast .
thou hast surprised me .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
hast thou killed tybalt ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
fie , fie , thou shamest thy shape , thy love , thy wit , which , like a usurer , abound ' st in all and usest none in that true use indeed which should bedeck thee .

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
ah !
how sweet is love itself when love ' s shadows are in joy !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
can i bring me letters from the friar ?
how is my lady ?
what is my father doing ?
how is my juliet ?
that way i can ask , for nothing can be ill if she dies .
she is very well , and can be ill .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
in fact , cousin , i love a woman who loves a man .
what a good markman !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
she is too fair , too wise , wisely too wise , to merit bliss .
ruled me too .
think of her now .
please , teach me how to do this !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i beg you , stars !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
ink and paper , and post horses .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i beseech you , sir , have mercy .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
just leave me and do the thing i do .
hast thou received letters to me from the friar ?
good morning , my good lord .
no matter .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i ' ll be with you soon .
well then , juliet , i will lie down .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
oh , mischief , art swift to enter in the thoughts of men !
as i remember , this house is empty .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
oh , ho !
quiet !
who calls so loud ?
goodbye , man .
i see that poor person .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
art thou so naked and full of wretchedness , and fear to die ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
the world is no friend to the world ' s law .
the world affords no law to make .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
oh , franciscan friar !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
this would be the voice of friar john .
come here , from mantua .
what did romeo do ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
what did my letter say , then , to romeo ?
oh , fortune !
please , brother , i ' ll go and bring it .
must i go back to the monument .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i will write to mantua , and keep her at my cell until romeo comes .
oh , living corse in a dead man ' s tomb !
give me a moment , boy .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
put it out , for i would be seen .
give me those things .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
that sounds like mattock and the wrenching iron .
i will go away , sir , and trouble you .
so thou shalt show me .
take that back .
youth , tempt a desperate man to stay .
go and leave me alone .
think not upon these matters .
let them affright themselves .
i beseech thee , please , put another sin upon my head by urging me to rage .
quiet , be quiet !
please , be gone .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
provoke me ?
have fun , boy !
oh lord , they killed them !
i will call the watch right away .
the tomb .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i think he told me he wanted me to marry juliet .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i ' ll bury thee in a tomb .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
oh , goodbye .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
death , that hath sucked the honey of breath , hath had no power yet .
thou art conquered .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
will i set up my everlasting rest , and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world - wearied flesh .
come on , look at your face .
come here , take your embrace .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
thus with a smile , i do .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
saint francis , my dear saint francis !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
tell me , my friend , what torch is yond that lends his light to grubs and eyeless skulls ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
is it possible ?
goodbye .
how long hath he stayed there ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
go with me to the vault .
yes , sir .
goodbye , then .
i won ' t go .
come upon me .
yes , i like some ill unthrifty thing .
as i did under this yew tree , i dreamt my master and killed him .
oh , romeo ! , alack , alack , what blood is this , which the stony sepulcher ?
oh , friar !
is my lord dead ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
what is my romeo doing ?
i hear noises .
yes , that nest of death , contagion , and unnatural sleep .
a greater power than we contradict thwarted our intentions .
go away .
in bosom there lies dead bodies , and paris too .
come on , i ' ll dispose of a sisterhood of holy nuns .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i will kiss your lips .
haply some poison doth hang on them , to make me die like a man .
yea , right ?
i ' ll brief everyone .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
go there and let me know .
this is the same .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
pathetic !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
go to the capulets .
wake up , the montagues .
go find some others .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
we found him in the churchyard .
let him come in till the prince come hither .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
a great victory .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
the people in the street cry " romeo , " some " juliet , " and all run with open outcry our monument .
go , seek , and know how this murder happened .
oh heavens !
oh , look how fast our daughter bleeds !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
o !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
alas , my liege , my wife is already dead .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
what further woe conspires against yourself ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
forbear , and let me be slave to thee . , bring forth the parties of suspicion . , bring forth the parties of suspicion .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
can he say in this case ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
quiet !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
oh , my lord , what do you want to say to my suit ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
she hath never seen the change of ages .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
such as do young men feel when well - appareled april walks on the heel of limping treads .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
come on , sirrah , trudge fair verona .
tell them to leave out their names ?
it is true that the shoemaker meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last , the fisher with his pencil and the painter with his nets .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
take new infection to eye , and the rank poison of the old will die too .
your plantain leaf is just like that .
for what , i beg ?
why , why , romeo ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
god help me , i ' m good e ' en .
i mean , sir , you can read ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
it is an amazing thing that i dream of .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
even though you live in verona , ladies of esteem are already mothers .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
what a young lady !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
what do you want ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i beseech you , listen .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

i swear , tell me .
you have to wear shoes , nimble soles .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
you are a very good man .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
but thou art moved to strike .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
a dog of that nature shall not move me .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
is love like a thing ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
if love can rough you , be with love .
let wantons light of tickle the whole world with their heels .
oh , we burn daylight , all right !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
what , may i ask ?
i dreamed of a dream .
and so am i .
well , what was going on ?
that dreamers always do .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
yes , yes , i see queen mab hath been with you .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
this is what she wants , peace , peace , peace !
this wind makes you talk of yourself , not us .
supper is over , and we shall come together .
lusty gentlemen .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
when good men shall lie all in one or two men ' s hands , and they smell unwashed too , a foul thing .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
we need to be here and there too .
cheerly boys .

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
is it true ?
he said , that romeo .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
therefore , be patient .
take care of him .
you won ' t endure him !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
go to bed , go to bed .
you are a saucy girl .
is so true , indeed ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i ' ll leave you now . , goodbye , cheerly , my hearts !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
o , please , dear saint , let me do what i do .
they come ; grant , lest thou turn to despair .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
madam , your mother craves a word from you .
is her mother dead ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i beg you , he that can lay of her shall have the chinks .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i ' m not going to my room .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i will show you a tyrant .
the heads of the maids ?
ay , the servants of the maids , or their servants .
take it in mind what wilt thou .
they say it makes sense to feel it .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
tis well to fish .
draw thy weapon !
my naked weapon is lying on the ground .
come here , nurse .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
what ' s he doing out there ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i did not .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
what ' s this about ?
what ' s this about ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
am i going forward when my heart is here ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
he fell like this and leaped this orchard wall .
come here , mercutio .
oh , i ' ll conjure !
quiet !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
this can only anger him .
my invocation is fair and true .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
if love can be blind , love can not hit the mark .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
her vestal is but sick and green , and none but fools can stop it .
cast it down !
it is , my dear .
yes , it is , my love .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
she speaks , but she says nothing .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
see how she holds on to her hand .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
oh , romeo , romeo !
wherefore , romeo ?
but name that which is my enemy .
i will be , romeo .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
therefore , kinsmen are stop to me .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i would do anything for the world they saw here .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
love me ?
i know not to say " ay , " and i will take no word .
what shall i do ?
not swear at all .
or , if thou wilt , swear by gracious self , which is the god of my idolatry , and i ' ll believe .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
why , leave me alone so unsatisfied ?
what satisfaction can thou have ?
exchange of love ' s faithful vows for mine .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
wouldst thou withdraw it now ?
what for , love ?
but be quiet , and give it again .
and i wish for the same thing i have .
my bounty is boundless as the sea , my deep voice .
i want some inside .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
stay a little longer .
i will come right away .
oh , blessed , blessed !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
three words , dear romeo , and be quiet .
do not fear me .
tell us about the law of our sides .
let them go .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i will write my thumb on them , which is a good thing to them , even if they bear it .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i swear , sir .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
did you quarrel , sir ?
quarrel , sir ?
goodbye , sir .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
quiet !
my name ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
the hour of nine .
i will fail .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i have forgotten why i came back .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
tis almost over .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
good night , good night !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
mickle is the powerful grace that lies in herbs , plants , stones and their true qualities .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
goodbye , father .
goodbye .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
therefore earliness doth me assure thou art uproused by distemperature .
or even if not so , here i hit it right : our romeo hath not been in bed .
that last part is true .
the sweeter rest was good enough .
rosaline , where is my ghostly father ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i bear no hatred , blessed man , for , oh , my intercession steads my foe .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
we ' ll be bound to each other in every possible way , except we marry you .
i ' ll tell you more later about when and where we met , how we fell in love , and how we exchanged promises , but now i ' m begging you to agree to marry us today .
o holy saint francis , this is a miracle !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
the groans you used to make are in my old ears .
there ' s a stain on your cheek from an old tear that ' s oft washed off yet .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
and you ' re changed ?
repeat this after me : you ' ll expect women to be faithful when men are so unreliable .
you scolded me for loving thy rosaline .
i scolded you obsessing about her , loving her , my student .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i can not tell you to get rid of one love and replace her with another .
o , i beg you , don ' t scold me .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
oh , she very well knows that you were acting like you were in love without knowing what love means .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
let ' s go out here .
i ' ll be in a rush .
wisely and slowly .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
the devil of romeo be thou ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i am not a servant .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i say it ' s a challenge .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
man knows not how to write thee a letter .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
o poor romeo !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
what , ' tybalt ' s story ?
did he hear what ?
he ' s thin , like a dried herring without its eggs , and he ' s got his girl .
o thy flesh , flesh , you ' re pale and weak a fish .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
can ' t you guess what i ' m saying ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
tis well .
you speak .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
dost thou ?
take this up , benvolio .
i ' ll not do this duel of wits .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
your humor is not a sauce .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
why , why , what ' s all this joking better groaning about love ?
you ' ll be sociable .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
here ' s good news .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
hark !
i ' ll not at your service .
let me hold my fan , peter .
good gentlemen .
nay , fair lady .
is it not now ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
look out here !
what kind of man are you ?
i am a man , my lady , that god has made for himself to ruin .
i pray you to speak the truth .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
gentlemen , do you not tell me where i can find young romeo ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i am the youngest man by that name , there is no younger , or worse .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
is the well well ?
tis well taken , i believe , too .
she will be a queen !
i ' ll put it out .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
why are you to your father ' s for lunch ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i ' ll leave you .
he looks more in one minute than he did in a whole month .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i ' ll do it myself , if i ' ll find someone who can .
that rat !
i ' ll not one of his sluts .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i ' ll do anything to please you for kicks .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
that scoundrel !
nurse , give my lady to your lady .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
o lord , lord , she ' s a happy woman .
what are you to tell her , nurse ?
you ' re only paying attention to me .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
good morrow , good nurse .
an hour of one of my men will go to you behind the abbey wall and give you a rope ladder .
speak .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
speak .
my mistress bids me to your mistress .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
now , sir .
what say you to my dear nurse ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i pray you , my man is not true as steel .
o sir , my mistress is the sweetest lady .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
they begin with the letter " r " o ' er . " ah , you jokester , that ' s the dog ' s name .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
nay , a thousand .
hark !
i ' ll not be ready .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
send your man .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
now , good sweet nurse , oh , lord , why do you be sad ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i am weary .
let me alone for a while .
my bones , my bones ache not much .
i thank you for your bones , and i had your bones .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
how do you be out of breath when you have enough breath to tell me that you ' re out of breath ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
not that question .
tell me if it ' s good or bad , and i ' ll wait for the details .
tell me i can not be satisfied .
is it not good to be bad ?
tis well you have a foolish choice .
you ' ll not know how to pick a man .
dost thou ?
no , not him , though his face is more handsome than any man ' s , and his legs are prettier , and he ' s not much to speak of , and they ' re beyond compare .
he ' s not the most courteous man in the world , but , believe me , he ' s gentle as a lamb .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
good morrow .
have you not had lunch ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
you told me i knew nothing .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
my heart is pounding so .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
your answer is not strange !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i .

there ' s a husband there who ' s waiting to make you his wife .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
o capulet you villain !
you ' re one step toward an enemy .
no , wish me not .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
amen to thee .
whatever misfortunes occur , they ' ll ruin the joy i feel with one look at her .
nay , love no other in moderation .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
too fast is as fast as too slow .
here comes the lady .
tis a footstep as light as hers will endure the rocky road of life .
that how flimsy and unreal pleasure is .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i ' ll give him equal thanks , as we ' ll .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
come , come with me , and we ' ll work the job .
i ' ll leave you , good mercutio , let ' s call it a day .
you ' ll like one of those guys who walks into a bar , slams his sword on the table , and then says , " i pray i never have to use you . " the time he ordered his second drink , he pulled his sword on the bartender for reason at all .
am i one of those guys ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
if there were two men like you , soon there ' s none because the two of you would kill each other .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
you ' re not fighting with a man who ' s cracking nuts because you have hazelnut - colored eyes .
you would not look for a fight that would .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
you say a man who coughed in the street because he woke up a dog that was sleeping in the sun .
do you argue it out with your tailor for wearing one of his new suits before the right season ?
and tying the new shoes he made with old laces ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
if i were in the fighting , the way you are , my life insurance would sky high .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
that ' s most foolish .
o great , come the capulets .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
hang out ? you think we are , musicians in a band ?
we look like musicians to you , you would expect nothing but noise .
we ' ll talk in a public place .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
look out here see us .
men ' s eyes were made to see things , not to see them .
i ' ll not move to please anyone .
tis well , peace be with you .
here comes my man , the man i ' ll be for thee .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i am thy villain .
tis so , then .

i ' ll leave you .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i ' ll do thee no more in this world , i swear .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i ' ll do that dog , that rat , that mouse , that mouse , that mouse , that mouse , that mouse , that mouse , that mouse , that mouse , that mouse , that mouse , that mouse , that mouse , that mouse , that mouse , that mouse , that mouse , that mouse , that mouse

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
tybalt , tybalt he was the best friend i had .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
tybalt was not my cousin .
tybalt is dead , and romeo has gone .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
it did not , it did .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
oh , he ' s a serpent disguised as a flower .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
he ' s a raven of the dove .
oh , nature , were you not in hell ?
was there such an evil book as a lovely cover ?
come , where ' s my servant ? , give me some brandy . , these griefs , these sorrows , old .
on thy romeo !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
he was to be ashamed .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i was not a beast to be angry at him .
are you not saying good things about the man who killed your cousin ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
my cousin the villain would not have killed my husband .
all this is not news .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i would not be glad about it , but it weighs on my like sins linger in thy guilty minds .
tybalt is dead , and romeo has banished thee .
that banishment is not the end of ten thousand tybalts .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
but to say that tybalt ' s dead and then say , " romeo has been banished . " say that is saying that my father , my mother , tybalt , romeo , romeo , juliet have all been killed .
romeo has banished thee . that news infinite death .
words do not express the pain .
where are my father and my mother , then ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i ' ll lead you there .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
this rope ladder .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
to your bedroom .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i know not where he is .
your romeo will not be here tonight .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
he ' s in friar lawrence ' s cell .
romeo , speak .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i have news for you the prince ' s punishment .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
what , banishment ?
be merciful and say " thy death . " exile is death .
" from now , you are banished from verona .
you should not endure this because the world is broad and wide .
there is none world for the walls of verona , except purgatory , torture , and hell itself .
to be banished from verona is being banished from the world , and banished from the world is not death .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
o deadly sin !
o most rude and unthankful boy !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
flies are like free men , i have heard .
and you say that exile is death ?
do you have no poison , no sharp knife , no weapon you use to kill me quickly , so disgraceful , except banishment ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
you ' re a member of a divine spiritual order of men who forgive sins , and you say you ' re my friend , how you have the heart to mangle me with the word banishment ?
you foolish madman , to tell me a tale .
your servants were fighting against your enemy ' s servants , i am sure .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
as we were trading blows , more and more people showed up to join the fight , till the prince came and came .
where ' s thy romeo ?
have you not seen him ?
i ' ll be glad he ' s here for this fight .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
he ' ll seen there many mornings crying tears that add drops to the morning dew and making a cloudy day cloudier with his sighs .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
oh , you ' re going to talk about banishment again .
do not say anything else .
oh , madmen like you are not deaf .
how should madmen hear , if wise men don ' t see ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
you ' re talking about something that you don ' t feel .
if you were as young as i am , if you were in love with juliet , if you had married her an hour ago , if you were lovesick like me , and if you were banished , then you might murder tybalt , if you were lovesick like me .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
where are you knocking hard ?
where do you come from ?
what do you want ?
o , holy friar , where is my lady ' s husband ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
o painful sympathy !
she ' s on the ground like him , blubbering and weeping , weeping and blubbering .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
for juliet ' s sake , for her sake , and mine .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
hark !
o sir , sir .
tis well death is the end for thee .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
how is she now ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
how is she now ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i pray by my holy order , i pray you were not smarter and more rational than this .
what have you tybalt ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
get up , man !
your juliet is gone .
tybalt to kill you , if you tybalt .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
romeo is gone .
good lord , i can not stay here all night listening to good advice .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
come , and tell my sweet to prepare to scold me .
nay , sir , this is a ring she gave me to give you .
hurry up , it ' s late .
this time i feel so much better !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
good night .
nothing depends on this : be out here before the night watchmen take their positions , or in disguise after daybreak .
tis a vacation in mantua .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
give me thy hand .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
speak .
things have gone out so unluckily , sir , that we ' ve had time to convince our daughter to marry you .
she loved her cousin tybalt dearly , and so i .
tis well we were born to die .
these times of pain are not for romance .
madam , good morrow .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i will not .
she is up in her room , with her sorrow .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
and tell her , tell me , on wednesday , what day is tuesday ?
good morrow , my lord .
hark !
ha !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
we ' ll have too large a celebration , we invite a friend or two .
nay , because tybalt was just killed , people might think that we ' d care about his memory as our relative if we have too grand a party .
therefore we ' ll have half a dozen friends to the wedding , and that ' s it .
what do you think wednesday ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
fare thee well home .
it is done , then .
are you mad ?
it ' s a long time till dawn .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
my love , are those streaks of light in the clouds parting in the west ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
that light is not daylight , i fear it .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
you ' ll have time to go yet .
let me be captured .
let me put thee to death .
i am content , if that ' s the way you say it .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
o , death , and death !
here ' s another .
it ' s daylight .
it is so .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
the lark hath a sweet division between night and night .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
and yet more light .
and more for thee .
speak .
dost thou ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
good day .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
o farewell , farewell !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i don ' t know , and he didn ' t tell me .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i hope you ' re not lucky to hear the true story by sticking around .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
hark !
i ' ll miss thee chance to send my love to you .
oh , you think we ' ll meet again ?
o god i have a soul that predicts evil things !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
and tell me , love , do you not pale to me ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
farewell , farewell !
good luck .
everyone says you ' re up your mind .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
is it my fault ?
what strange reason could not she have here ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
madam , i am not well .
will you go to your cousin ' s death forever ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
so cry not .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
let me weep for a great loss .
you will not feel the loss , the man you weep for will .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
villain , madam ?
that villain , romeo .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
nay , madam , he is beyond my reach .
i say that one can not avenge my cousin ' s death except me !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i take the love i had for my cousin and take it out on the body of the man killed him .
go out the way , and i ' ll take the right man .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
tell me not .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

tomorrow i ' ll be a feast that we ' ve celebrated for many years .
at my humble house tonight , you may see dazzling stars that walk on the ground and light the sky from above .
in the most beautiful city of verona , where our story takes place a long - standing hatred between two families erupts into violence , and citizens their hands with the blood of their fellow citizens .

their deaths make an answer to their parents ' feud .

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
it ' s eleven years since the earthquake .

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
you ' ll not do this .

but i ' m still laughing to think that the baby stopped crying and said , " yes . " i swear , she had a bump on her forehead as big as a rooster ' s testicle .

but i ' ll not myself fall for him any more than your permission allows .
nothing ' s out of order .
follow thou straight after me .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
o girl , for a man who ' ll give you happy nights at the end of happy days .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

it ' s out of fashion to give lengthy explanations that can not .
let them judge us if they please .
give me thy hand .
i ' ll not want to dance .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
leave me , tell me .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

his arrow hath pierced me too deeply , i ' ll fly high with his cheerful feathers .
i am the heavy weight of love .

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
to run away .
you ' ll not stand and fight .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
is thy love tender ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
tis playful people with light hearts .
nay , we ' re wasting precious daylight .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
no , we ' ll not , it ' s night .
we mean well by going to this masquerade ball , but it ' s smart of us to go .
what , i ask thee ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
well was your dream ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
she rides over a courtier ' s lips , and he makes money off of someone .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
mercutio , come .
the wind you ' re blowing is blowing us off our course .
dinner is over , and we ' ll go there too late .
o thy lover boys !
the drum .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
only one or two men have all the good manners , and even they are dirty , are they not .
to the stools , the sideboards , and the plates .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
nay , boy , i ' ll be ready .
they ' ll leave for you in the great chamber .
we ' ll be in two places at once , both here and there !
good morrow , boys .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
good morrow , gentlemen .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
good morrow , gentlemen .
i pray thee , it must be forty years .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
lucentio ' s son is not that , sir .
he ' s forty years old .
are you to tell me that ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i ' ll know thee , sir .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
my eyes were liars , then , because i saw true beauty tonight .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
why are you not angry ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
is it not , romeo ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
down , gentle cousin .
let him alone .
he himself looks like a dignified gentleman , and , to tell you the truth , he has a most extensive history throughout verona as a virtuous and well behaved young man .
i can not insult him in my own house for all the wealth in this town .
not so down .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
go , go , go .
you ' re an insolent boy .
is that how it is done , then ?
i know not what i ' ll do .
do you have to contradict me , do you ?
i ' ll teach you a way .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
nay , saint , let thy lips know what hands do .
grant my prayer so my faith wouldst not turn to despair .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
give me my sin .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
where is her mother ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
let me tell you , the man marries her will not be rich .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
you ' ll be right .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i ' ll not be a harsh master to them .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
it ' s a good idea you ' re not a piece of fish .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i have put my naked sword on .
come , nurse .
what is that gentleman ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i ' ll not know his name .
ask thee .
what ' s this ?
what ' s this ?
the strangers are all gone .
but he hath his speeches of love to a woman who ' s supposed to be his enemy .
and juliet ' s as much in love as he , but she has no more opportunity to meet her lover .
but love gives them no power , and time gives them the meet , sweetening the extreme danger with extreme pleasure .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
he fell over this and jumped over this orchard wall .
let him come , mercutio .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
hark !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
speak not one rhyme , and i ' ll die .
just cry out , " ah me ! " and " dove . "
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
what i ' m saying ' s anger against him .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
there ' s no point in looking for him if he didn ' t want to be found .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
it goes .
there ' s my lady !
nay , it is my love .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
she ' s talking , but she ' s nothing .
what now ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
she ' s speaking to me .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
look how she puts her hand upon her cheek .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
o , my lord !
are you mad ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
and ' tis you a montague ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
and why should you come ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
your relatives are not obstacle .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
at me kindly , and i ' ll be invincible against their hate .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i ' d rather they kill me have live without your love .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
do you love me ?
i pray you ' ll say " no , " and i ' ll believe you .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
don ' t swear at all .
you have sworn , swear by your wonderful self , which is the god i worship like an idol , and then i ' ll believe you .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
you bring me no joy , i ' ll take joy in this exchange of promises tonight .
our love , which right now is like a flower bud in the summer air , may not be a beautiful flower by the next time we meet .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
oh , are you not leaving me unsatisfied ?
what satisfaction do you have tonight ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
do you take it back ?
why do you know that , my love ?
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
sweet montague , come .
come here for a time .
i ' ll back .
o blessed night , blessed night !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
three words , dear romeo , and it ' s good night for thee .
don ' t fret about me .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
let them begin .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
you mean they dare not .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i ' ll draw my thumb .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
a fight ?
good morrow , sir .
i ' ll send thee the messenger .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
hark !
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
o ' clock .
i ' ll fail thee .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
it ' s morning .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i am not your bird .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
good night , good night .
parting is such sweet sorrow that i ' ll say good night tomorrow .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i ' ll not see my priest , to ask for his help and tell him about my good luck .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
nay , before the sun comes up and burns away the dew , i have this basket of mine with poisonous weeds and medicinal flowers .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
from the earth ' s womb , different sorts of plants and animals come forth , and the earth her children many excellent forms of nourishment .
for herbs , plants , and stones .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
there are none elements in thee , in men as well as in herbs , good and evil .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
farewell , good father .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
who greets me early in the morning ?
young man , ' tis wrong if you ' re getting out of bed this early .
every old man has worries , and worried men never get any sleep , young men ' ll have a care in the world .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
therefore , the fact that you ' ve been awake this early tells me you ' ve been upset with some anxiety .
if that not the case , then this must not be the answer : you , romeo , have been to bed tonight .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
that ' s all , my boy .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
