xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i pray you , the sweet peace and rest i feel in my heart .

good night , good night .
parting is such sweet sorrow that i ' ll say good night tomorrow .
i hope you can not peacefully .
i would i were sleep and peace , i would spend the night with you .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
darkness is of the sun ' s path a drunk man .
nay , before the sun comes up and burns away the dew , i have this basket of mine with poisonous weeds and medicinal flowers .
upon the earth is nature ' s mother and nature ' s tomb .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
virtue to th ' vice it ' misused .
the little rind of this weak flower there is not poison and powerful medicine .
there are none elements in thee , in men as well as in herbs , good and evil .
thy evil is dominant , death the body like cancer .
farewell , good father .
god save you .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
young man , ' tis wrong if you ' re getting out of bed this early .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
if that not the case , then this must not be the answer : you , romeo , have been to bed tonight .
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
i am not a sweeter than sleep .
what , rosaline father ?
that ' s all , my boy .
but have not you been ?
i ' ll tell you again you have asked me again .
you have heard the sacred cure both of us .
i can not carry no hatred , holy man , my will my enemy .
