riddling but riddling , shrift .
don ' t know my heart ' s dear love is set on the fair daughter of rich capulet .
as mine on hers , so hers is set on mine , and all combined , save what must combine .
when and where and how we met , we wooed and made exchange of vow , i ' ll tell as we do , but this i pray : that consent to marry us today .
holy saint francis , what a change is coming !
who is , whom didst thou love so dear , so forsaken ?
young men ' s love truly shines in their eyes , but in their eyes .
the sun yet sighs from heaven , old groans ring yet in my ancient ears .
yes , here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit of an old tear that is washed off yet again .
if e ' er wast and these woes thine , and these troubles were all for rosaline .
and thou art changed ?
pronounce this sentence for women who fall when there ' s no strength in men .
chid ' st forgive me for loving rosaline .
for doting , for now , pupil .
and badest love too .
in a hurry , to lay one in , another to have .
i pray , chide yourself .
the other so well .
oh , but she knew well love to read by rote , that could spell .
but come , young waverer , come , go with me , in one respect i ' ll assistant be , for this may be so happy prove to turn your rancor to pure love .
yes , let us .
i can stand on my own .
wisely and wisely .
they stumble like that run .
what does the devil do about this romeo ?
who came he not ?
his father ' s coming .
i want to go with his man .
why , that pale hard - hearted wench , that rosaline , loves him so , that he will never run mad .
yes , the kinsman went to old capulet , sent a message to his father ' s house .
what a challenge , my lord .
yes , romeo will do it .
man that can write answer a letter .
yes , he will get the letter ' s master , how he , being dared .
alas , romeo !
and is he a good man , tybalt ?
where , where is tybalt ?
the king ?
his roe , like a dried herring .
oh , flesh , flesh , how fishified !
here is he , the numbers that petrarch flowed in .
morrow , you both .
counterfeit , did i give you ?
the slip , sir , the slip .
can you conceive of anything ?
yes , i am the very pink of the world .
i like a man as good as you .
yes , better .
well , sir .
thank you .
you know exactly what you do .
what , art thou drawn between these two ?
listen to us , good benvolio .
take my wits .
switch and spurs , switch and spurs , i won ' t be a match .
yes , if our wits run the wild - goose chase , i am sure , for thou hast more of the wild - goose in one of my five senses than , i am sure , i have in my whole five .
was i supposed to be with you there for the goose ?
thou wast always with me for anything when thou wast there for the goose .
i will bite by the way for that joke .
please , good goose , bite .
wit is like a bitter sweeting .
it is like a sharp sauce .
and why is it served into a sweet goose ?
here ' s a wit of cheveril , that comes from an inch narrow to an ell broad to an ell broad !
i can stretch it out for that word " broad , " which , added to the goose , proves far and a goose .
why , is this better than for love ?
now be sociable .
go now , romeo .
wouldst thou else have made thy tale large enough .
oh , deceived .
i would have made it short , for i was coming to the whole extent of my life , and meant , indeed , to occupy the longer .
don ' t get goodly gear .
two , get a shirt and a smock .
quiet !
oh , anon !
call my fan , peter .
good morning , gentlemen .
god be good , fair gentlewoman .
is it good to be en ?
no less , i tell you , for the bawdy hand of the dial is upon the prick of the dial .
get out of here , you !
a man are you talking about ?
yes , yes , that god made him to mar .
my troth , it is said .
what does he do to mar , quoth he ?
gentlemen , can you tell me where i may find the young romeo ?
i tell you , young romeo will be older when you have found him than he was when you sought him .
i know the truth of that , for fault of a worse .
thank you .
what , is the well still running ?
well taken , i ' m faith , too , no , faith .
she will indite him to death .
ho !
what hast thou found here ?
what will you do to your father ' s ?
we ' ll go to thither first .
i will , you .
a gentleman , nurse , that to hear himself talk , and so will in a minute than he will stand to in a month .
an he could speak any thing against me , i ' ll take him down , an he were , and such jacks .
and if i do , i ' ll find those that shall die .
oh , knave !
i think of his flirting - gills .
i think of his skains - mates .
i never saw no man like you before his pleasure .
if i had , my weapon should have been out already , i swear to you .
i draw as soon as possible as soon as another man i see occasion in a good quarrel and the law my side .
now , before god , i am vexed about that every part about quivers .
oh , knave !
please , let me go to lady and mistress .
i protest unto , good heart , and i , i will tell her as much .
lord , lord , she will be like a woman .
what can tell her , nurse ?
dost mark me .
and there she shall be , friar lawrence ' cell shrived and shrived .
and good morning , good nurse .
behind the abbey wall within this hour my man shall be with and bring cords made like a rugby tackle made like a rugby , which to the high top - gallant of my joy must be my convoy in the secret night .
goodbye .
be trusty , and i ' ll quit .
goodbye .
tell me to mistress .
god in heaven bless thee !
thank you , sir .
what sayst thou , my dear ?
is your man coming ?
what did you ne hear say , " two may keep , putting one away " ?
warrant , please , my name ' s as true as steel .
oh , sir , my mistress is the sweetest lady . , lord , lord !
when a prating thing happens . , oh , there is a nobleman in town , one paris , that would fain lay knife aboard , but she , good soul , had as lief see a toad , a very toad , as see him .
i tell her and tell her that paris is the properer man .
but , i ' ll warrant you , when i get married , she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world .
doth ' t ay , what of that ?
an ah , mocker , that ' s the dog ' s name .
let me go to lady .
ay , yes , a little . , peter !
oh , anon !
go and pace .
the clock never stopped when i did send the nurse .
perchance she can meet him .
that ' s true .
oh , she is just lame !
love ' s heralds ' s thoughts , which ten minutes later glide faster than the sun ' s beams , driving back shadows over louring hills .
now is the sun upon the highmost hill of this day , and from twelve till twelve is three , yet she is come .
had she affections and warm youthful blood , she would be as in motion as a ball .
my bandy won ' t help her to my sweet love , and his to mine .
old folks , many feign as they were dead , unwieldy , slow , heavy lead .
god help her , she comes again . , honey , what ?
hast thou ever met with him ?
send him away .
go to the gate .
yes , good sweet nurse , o lord , why look ' st thou sad ?
be sad , yet tell them merrily .
if good , thou shamest the music of sweet news it makes me so sour a face .
i ' m aweary .
leave me alone .
oh , how my bones hurt !
i would thou hadst my bones and i would hear news .
do you want to stay awhile ?
do you not see that i just got out of breath ?
how art thou out of breath when thou hast breath to say to me that art out of breath ?
the excuse that dost make in this is longer than the tale dost excuse .
is good news good , or bad ?
go to that .
either , and i won ' t stay the circumstance .
let me be satisfied .
is good or bad ?
well then , you have made a very good point .
you know how to choose a man .
quiet !
yes , he , though his face be better than any man ' s , yet his leg excels all men ' s , and for a hand and a foot and a foot and a body , even though they are not to be talked on , yet they are compare .
he is like the flower of courtesy , but , i ' ll warrant him , as a lamb .
go ahead , wench .
god help me .
what , have you dined home ?
no , please .
but all this did i do .
what does he want of our lives ?
of course of that ?
my back looks like a t else .
oh , my back , my back !
i don ' t faith , i wish i could be better .
oh , sweet , sweet nurse , what , my love ?
your love , an honest gentleman , and a courteous , and a kind , and a kind , and , i warrant , a virtuous , is your mother ?
what is my mother doing ?
why , she is beautiful .
who should she be ?
how peculiarly repented !
your love , an honest gentleman , where is your mother now ?
god ' s lady , what are you doing here ?
marry , please , i trow .
is this the poultice on my bones ?
go ahead , henceforward your messages .
here ' s a coil .
yes , what romeo ?
have you ever left to go to shrift ?
i have .
hie you , friar lawrence ' s cell .
there 's a husband who can make you a wife .
wipe the wanton blood up in your cheeks .
they won ' t be in scarlet any news .
hie you to my house .
i ' ll go get a ladder , by the which your must climb a bird ' s nest soon when it is dark .
goodbye .
i ' ll stay here .
hie you out of the cell .
i am but the peace .
put up sword , or manage it part of these men with me .
what , drew , and of whom ?
i swear the word , as i hell , all montagues , and all .
have mercy , coward !
come on , bills and partisans !
quiet !
help them down !
get down the capulets !
let down the montagues !
what noise is this ?
take my sword , i swear !
old montague is coming here , and his blade in hand of death .
oh , villain capulet !
then stir one foot to seek a foe .
hie up high !
be honest , nurse .
amen to that .
but come what sorrow can , it can countervail the exchange of joy that one minute gives me in her sight .
therefore , love .
doth so .
not too swift as tardy as yourself .
here comes the lady .
yes , so light a foot will ne ' t wear out the flint .
listen to my ghostly confessor .
shall we thank , then , for both of us .
as much to him , then as much to himself .
ah , juliet , if the measure of thy joy be heaped like mine , and that skill be more to blazon it , then sweeten with breath this neighbor air , and let rich ' s tongue unfold the imagined happiness that both receive in both by this dear encounter .
more rich in fact than in words , brags of his substance , of ornament .
come on , come with me , and we will be short .
i hope so , good mercutio , let ' s go .
thou art like one of those fellows that , when he enters the confines of a tavern , claps me on his sword upon the table and says " god send me no need of ! " and , the end of the second cup , draws it on the drawer when indeed there is no need of .
am i such a fellow ?
come , come , thou art as hot as a jack in mood as any in italy , and as soon to be moved .
and what about to ?
yes , an there were two such things , we should have , for one would kill the other .
yes , why , wilt thou quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast .
thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts , having no other reason than because thou hast hazel .
what eye but such an eye would spy on such an eye ?
head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat , and yet head ' s been beaten as addle as an egg for quarreling .
thou hast quarreled with a man for in the street because he hath awoken dog that hath lain asleep in the sun .
didst thou fall out like a tailor for wearing his new doublet before easter ?
who , tying his new shoes with old ribbon ?
and yet wilt thou not tutor me from !
an i were going to quarrel as art , any man should buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter .
what about the fee ?
simple enough !
my head , goes the capulets .
my heel , i care not .
put it on with something .
it means a word and a blow .
if you shall find apt to that , sir , an answer you will give me .
can you take some occasion without giving ?
mercutio , consort with romeo .
what , could you make us minstrels ?
an hour or two ago , look to hear nothing but discords .
we all go in the public haunt of men .
withdraw unto private place , and explain of your grievances , or else depart .
go all eyes on us .
men who looked to look and let them gaze .
i will for no man ' s pleasure , i swear .
yes , peace be with you , sir .
here comes my man again .
i won ' t be hanged , sir , if he comes your livery .
tybalt , the only reason that i have to love doth excuse the appertaining rage to such a degree .
villain , i do not .
therefore , goodbye .
i can see thou st me .
boy , this shall excuse the fact that hast done me wrong .
come on , turn and draw .
and yes , good capulet , which name i tender as dearly as my own , too .
dishonourable , vile submission !
what wouldst not have me ?
will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher so the ears can hear ?
make no mistake , lest mine be your ere it be out .
i thank you for coming .
mercutio , put rapier up .
come here , tybalt .
i am .
what a plague both your houses !
i sped up .
is he dead and hath nothing else ?
what , hurt yourself ?
marry , don ' t marry .
where is my page ? , come here , villain , a surgeon .
goodbye , man .
the hurt could be much worse .
no , don ' t be so deep as a well nor so wide as a - door , but don ' t serve .
for me tomorrow , and you shall hear me a man .
i peppered , i swear , for this world .
what a plague both your houses !
what a dog , a rat , a mouse , a mouse , a cat scratch a man to death !
what a braggart , a rogue , a villain that the book of love !
why did the devil send you to us ?
i was just under your arm .
i want all for the same .
leave me some house , benvolio , or i shall .
what a plague both your houses !
they have worms ' s meat of some kind .
i have it , and so do you .
oh , your majesty !
oh , romeo , romeo , brave mercutio is coming !
here comes the furious tybalt back again .
in fact , and mercutio slain !
either or i , or both , go with him .
yes , wretched boy , that didst consort with him shalt thou consort with him .
this shall do that .
oh , romeo , gone , gone !
the citizens are ready , and tybalt is coming .
stand still .
the prince will doom death even if taken .
please , be gone , please !
why did you stay ?
which ran did he say that mercutio ?
tybalt , that murderer , which he killed ?
there , that tybalt .
goodbye , nephew .
what were you doing when it happened ?
what are the vile beginners doing about this fray ?
noble prince , i must discover all the unlucky manage of this fatal situation .
there , the man , slain by young romeo , that slew kinsman , mercutio .
oh , tybalt , my cousin !
my brother ' s coming !
oh , cousin !
benvolio , who killed this bloody fray ?
oh , romeo , he says aloud , hold , friends !
yes , part ! " and , swifter than his tongue , his agile arm beats down their fatal points , and ' twixtio hits the life of stout mercutio , and tybalt hits the life of stout mercutio , and tybalt hits the life of stout mercutio , and tybalt hits the life of stout mercutio , and tybalt hits the life of stout mercutio , and tybalt hits the life of stout mercutio , and tybalt hits the life of stout mercutio , and tybalt hits the life of stout mercutio , and tybalt hits the life of stout mercutio , and tybalt hits the life of stout mercutio , and tybalt hits the life of stout mercutio , and tybalt hits the life of stout mercutio , and tybalt hits the life of stout mercutio , and tybalt hits the life of stout mercutio , and tybalt hits the life of stout mercutio , and tybalt hits the life of stout mercutio , and tybalt hits the life of stout mercutio , and tybalt hits the life of stout mercutio , and tybalt hits the life of stout mercutio , and tybalt hits the life of stout mercutio , and tybalt hits the life of stout mercutio , and tybalt hits the life of ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere ere
but by and by comes back to romeo , who had but entertained revenge , and to don ' t they go like lightning , for ere i could draw to part them was tybalt slain .
and , he , romeo , turn and fly away .
this is the truth , benvolio , die .
he does not lie .
twenty of them fought here in this black strife , and those who could but kill one life .
i wish for justice , which , prince , give me peace .
slew tybalt .
no , romeo must not .
slew him because he slew mercutio .
what does the price of his dear blood owe ?
his conclusion concludes but what the law should end , the tybalt dies .
i have an advantage in your hearts , proceeding .
i ' d like amerce to tell you so strong a fine that you shall all repent the loss of mine .
i will listen to pleading and excuses .
nor tears nor tears shall buy out abuses , use .
bear this and attend to our will .
but murders like pardoning those that kill .
lovers can see to do their amorous rites by their own beauties , or , if love be blind , it can with night .
come on , night , - suited matron , all in black , and learn me how to lose a winning match played for a pair of stainless maidenhoods .
hood up my unmanned blood , with black mantle , till strange , grow bold , think true acted simple modesty .
yes , good night .
goodbye , romeo .
come , day in night , for wilt thou lie upon the wings of night whiter than new snow a raven ' s back .
and when i shall die , take him and cut him out in little stars , and he will go the face of heaven so fine that the world will be in love with night and pay worship to the garish sun .
the cords that bid fetch ?
ay , ay , the whole thing .
ay , what about what ?
why dost thou wring hands ?
oh , welladay !
we are undone , lady , we are undone !
alack , get out of the way !
heaven be envious ?
oh , romeo , though heaven does not .
what devil art thou that keeps me thus ?
this torture roared in dismal hell .
what did romeo do ?
say but " ay , " and that bare vowel sounds just like the - darting of cockatrice .
i am not i if there be such an or those eyes shut that makes no answer " ay . " determine of my weal or woe .
go to prison , please , ne ' er look on .
oh , vile , to earth .
tybalt , tybalt , the best thing i ever had !
that i should live to see you die .
where is romeo , and is tybalt coming ?
where is my dearest and my lord ?
tybalt is coming , and romeo .
god help me , romeo ' s hand is tybalt ' s blood ?
it did , it did .
the next day , it happens .
oh , serpent hid with a flowering face !
ever since dragons keep fair a cave ?
oh , dove dove , wolvish wolvish ravening lamb !
nature , what wouldst thou to do in hell when thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend in moral paradise of such sweet flesh ?
was ever book containing any vile matter bound ?
come on , where ' s my man ? , give me some aqua vitae . , give me some aqua vitae . , give me some aqua vitae .
go to romeo !
oh , blistered tongue for such a wish !
he was going to shame me .
upon his brow is to sit , for don ' t a throne where honor may be crowned .
oh , monarch of the universal earth , oh , what a beast was i chide at him !
what will you do of him that killed your cousin ?
why , villain , didst thou kill my cousin ?
that villain , cousin , have killed my husband .
this is comfort .
wherefore weep am i ?
i would forget about it , fain , but oh , it makes me to my memory , damned guilty deeds to sinners ' minds .
tybalt is dead , and romeo is .
that " one word " banished , " that one word " banished " slain ten .
tybalt ' s name was woe enough , it had to be there .
or , if sour woe delights in fellowship and needly will be ranked with other griefs , why followed not , when she said " tybalt ' s dead , " nay , or " father , " nay , or " lamentations ?
a rearward following tybalt ' s death , " romeo is banished . " speak that word , is father , mother , tybalt , juliet , juliet , all dead .
romeo is dead . there is no end , no limit , bind , bound , in that word ' s name .
no words that woe sound .
where is my father and my mother , then ?
and wailing like tybalt ' s corse .
will you go to them now ?
i will find you thither .
did they cut his wounds with his wounds ?
shall be spent are dry , for romeo ' s banishment .
tie up those cords . poor ropes , you are beguiled , both of you , for romeo is dead .
he asked you for a highway to my bed , but i , a maid , maiden - maiden .
oh and death , romeo , my maidenhead !
hie yourself to your chamber .
i don ' t find romeo comfort you .
i wot well when he is .
hark , your romeo will come here at once .
i ' m going to talk to him .
he is lying on lawrence ' s cell .
come on , forth .
come here , fearful man .
father , what happened ?
be familiar is my dear son , sour company .
i bring news of news the prince ' s coming .
what more than doomsday is the prince ' s ?
oh , banishment !
merciful , say " death , " for exile hath more in his voice , much more than death .
so say " banishment . " hence from verona art banished .
yes , for the world is wide and wide .
there is no world verona walls , purgatory , or hell itself .
" banished " is banished from the world , and everyone ' s exile is banished .
calling death " banishment , " cutt st my head off with a golden ax and smilest the stroke that kills me .
oh , deadly sin !
o , unthankfulness !
no torture and not .
no validity , no more honorable state , more in carrion flies than romeo .
may this , but i think this must fly .
they are all free men , but i am .
and sayst that exile is not dying ?
hadst no poison mixed , no sharp - ground knife , no sudden mean of death , though ne so mean , but " banished " to kill me ? , " banished " to kill me ?
friar , listen to the damned that word in hell .
attends to it .
how hast the heart , being a divine , confessor , a sin - absolver , and my professed , to mangle me that word " banished " ?
man , listen to me a little bit .
so were the servants of your adversary , and , fighting ere i did approach .
i want to part them all .
we were interchanging thrusts and blows , came more and more and fought on part and part , till the prince , who appeared to be part and part , fought on part and part , until the prince died .
where , where is romeo ?
saw you with him ?
be glad i was not at this fray .
toward him i made , but he was ware of and stole into the covert of the covert of the cia .
many a morning hath he been there , with augmenting the fresh morning ' s dew , adding to clouds more clouds with his own .
all so as the all - cheering sun should in the farthest east begin to draw the shady curtains from aurora ' s bed , away from light home , away from light home ,
oh , speak of banishment again .
no more .
oh , i wish i could see that madmen have ears .
how do they look , when that wise men have eyes ?
let no dispute with any estate .
canst thou speak of that dost not feel ?
wert thou as young as i , juliet love , an hour but married , tybalt murdered , doting like me , and like me banished , then mightst thou speak , tybalt murdered , doting like me , and like me banished , then mightst thou speak , then mightst tear hair and fall upon the ground , as i do now , taking the measure of an unmade grave .
goodbye .
knock again .
please , romeo , hide .
not even i , unless the breath of heartsick , mistlike , infold me from the world of heartsick , infold me from the world of heartsick .
knocks hard enough ?
whence did you come ?
isn ' t your will ?
friar , please , tell me , holy friar , where is my lady ' s lord ?
where ' s romeo ?
yes , he is in my mistress ' case , in her case .
woeful , piteous situation !
so she did , blubbering and weeping .
yes , an you look like a man .
for juliet ' s sake , go for her .
do you fall into so deep an o ' clock ?
quiet !
yes , sir , sir .
death isn ' t the end of everything .
spakest of what ?
how is it for her ?
what is she doing ?
and how did she get here ?
and what did my lady want to our canceled love ?
if that name , shot from the deadly level of a gun , did murder her , that name ' s cursed with her kinsman .
please , tell me , friar , tell me , in what part of this anatomy doth my lodge ?
tell me , that i could sack the hateful mansion .
what art thou a man ?
acts denote the wrath of a beast .
thou hast surprised me .
my holy , i thought disposition was better tempered than tempered .
hast thou killed tybalt ?
why rail st thou on birth , the heaven , and earth ?
fie , fie , thou shamest thy shape , thy love , thy wit , which , like a usurer , abound ' st in all and usest none in that true use indeed which should bedeck thee .
wake up , wake up , man !
juliet is alive , for whose dear sake wast but recently dead , there art thou happy .
tybalt would kill himself , but thou slew ' st tybalt , there art thou happy .
the law that threatened death becomes a friend and turns it to exile , there happy .
what a pack of light upon back , happiness courts in her best array ,
but , like a misbehaved and sulky wench , pout ' st upon fortune and love .
yes , get to love , as was decreed .
ascend her , then , and let her die .
commend me to lady , and bid her hasten all the house to bed , which makes them apt unto thee .
romeo is dead .
o lord , i have stayed here the whole night to hear good counsel .
come on , learning is over !
yes , and my sweet prepare to chide me .
sir , a woman who bid me give you , sir .
hie you , make , for it ' s late .
how wonderful my comfort is revived like this !
hence .
good night .
and here stands all your state : either gone before the watch be set , or by the break of dawn .
come in , in mantua .
i won ' t find out your man , and he shall signify from time to time every good hap to you that .
give me some time .
good morning .
goodbye .
have to fall ' n out , sir , so unluckily , that we have had no time to move our way .
look at you , she loves her kinsman tybalt dearly , and i love her .
well , we were going to die anyway .
these times of woe to woo me .
madam , please .
commend yourself to your daughter .
then i will , and know her tomorrow .
she is mewed to her weight .
sir paris , i will make a tender of my child ' s love .
acquaint her here of my son paris ' s love , and bid her , mark you , on , but , oh , stop !
what day is this ?
goodbye , my lord .
quiet !
ha , ha .
did you like this haste ?
we ' re great , ado , a friend or two .
for instance , hark you , tybalt slain so late , it may be thought we killed him , being our kinsman , if we revel much .
we ' ll have some half a friend , and there ' s an end .
what say you , thursday ?
my lord , i wish that were tomorrow .
get you out of here .
o thursday be it , go you to juliet ere you go to bed .
wilt thou ?
it is near noon .
it was like the nightingale , and the lark , that the hollow of thine ear .
yes , yes , envious streaks do lace the severing clouds in yonder .
good night ' s candles are out and jocund day stands on the mountain tops .
yon light is brighter than daylight , i swear it , i do .
it is some kind of meteor that the sun exhales to be to this night a torchbearer , and light on the way to mantua .
stay for now .
don ' t need ' st to be gone .
let me go ta en .
let me put myself to death .
i am content , so wilt thou have it so soon .
i have to stay here longer than will to go .
oh , death , and death !
here ' s something .
it is only day .
it is .
it is like the lark that of tune , straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps .
the lark makes a sweet division .
this doth , for she divideth us all .
light and light , light and light .
oh , light and light , dark and our woes !
goodbye .
yes ?
your lady mother is waiting for your chamber .
the day is coming .
yes , window , day in and life out .
goodbye , goodbye .
one kiss , and i won ' t .
and in his chamber himself , shuts up his windows , locks up his windows , and makes himself an artificial night .
my noble uncle , what do you mean by the cause ?
i wish it never happened nor can learn of him .
what have you importuned him for , exactly ?
i would wert so happy by stay to hear shrift . , come , madam , let ' s get away .

i will omit that may convey my greetings , love , to each other .
oh , think st we shall meet again ?
god help me , i have an excellent idea - divining soul .

either my eyesight fails or look pale .
and tell me , love , in my eye you look beautiful .
dry our blood quickly .
adieu , adieu , adieu !
oh , fortune !

what procures her hither ?
why , how , now ?
madam , i do well .
for your cousin ' s death ?
what , would you wash him from his grave with me ?
an if thou couldst , couldst make him live .
therefore , have mercy .
some grief shows much of love , much of grief , some want of wit .
let for such a feeling of loss .
shall you hear the loss , but the friend which you weep for .
feeling so sorry for the loss , choose but not weep the friend .
well , then , weep ' st not so much for his death , as that the villain lives which slaughtered him .
who , villain madam ?
that villain , romeo .
that is the traitor who murdered me .
ay , madam , the reach of these men , my hands .
would i venge on my cousin ' s death !
weep more .
i ' ll send you to mantua , where that banished runagate doth live , shall give him such an unaccustomed dram that he shall keep tybalt company .
and , i hope , be satisfied too .
yes , i shall be satisfied with romeo , till i behold him , dead , is my poor heart for a vexed heart .
madam , if you could find out but a man to bear a poison , i would temper it , that romeo should , upon receipt thereof , in spite of .
oh , wreak the way i bore my cousin with his body that slaughtered him !
go find the means , and i ' ll find a way .
but i ' ll tell tidings , girl .
and joy , well in a desperate time .
are they coming , your ladyship ?
well , well , thou hast a daughter , child .
oh , madam , in happy , day is that ?

i wonder at this , that i wed him , that should be husband , comes to woo me .
i beg you , tell my lord and father , madam , i will marry .
and i , i swear it shall be romeo , whom you know i hate , rather than paris .
these are certainly indeed !

tell him so , and see how he will take it .
how ?
what a conduit girl ?
what , in tears , evermore showering ?
have you forgotten to ask our decree ?
i wish the fool were dead to her grave !
how , will she die ?
is she proud of anything ?
doth she count her blessed , unworthy , unworthy as she is , that we have wrought so much a marriage to be her bride ?
not proud of you , that you have to .

you won ' t be tomorrow for this night ' s watching .
i have watched now all for lesser cause , and ne ' t been sick .

what a jealous hood !
fellow , what is there to do ?
make me stop , make me stop , sirrah .
i have to have a head , sir , that will find out logs , and for the matter .

how sound is she ?
ay , let the rest of you come in your bed .
he ' s scared you up , i faith .
will it be possible ?
what noise is going on ?
oh , lamentable day !
what is the matter ?
look , here comes someone .
oh , heavy day !
oh , o me !
my child , my only life , revive , or i will die with ! , help , help ! , help , help !
for shame , bring me back .
her lord is coming .
she ' s dead , dead , she ' s dead .
alack , get out of the way !
alack , come here .
she ' s dead , because she ' s dead , she ' s dead !
yes ?
tell me to see her .
oh , alas !
she ' s freezing .
her blood is settled and her joints are fully healed .
life and these lips have been separated .
death takes her like an untimely frost upon the sweetest flower of all the field .
oh , lamentable day !
oh , woeful .
yes , that hath ta ' en her to make me wail , ties up my tongue and will let me speak .
what , is the bride going to church now ?
go to bed , to return .
death is like my son in law .
yes , my heir .
my husband he hath wedded .
i will die , and let him die .
life , being living , is death .
have i ever thought to see this ' s face , and doth it give me such a sight as this ?
oh , accursed , hateful , hateful hateful !
most hour that e ever saw in lasting labor of his pilgrimage .
one , poor one , one poor and loving child , but one thing to rejoice and comfort in , and hath catched it from my sight !
oh woe !
oh , woeful , woeful , woeful !
was so black like a day as this .
woeful day , woeful day , woeful day !
beguiled , wronged , slain !
oh , most detestable death , by beguiled , by cruel overthrown !
oh , love !
death !
not even life , in death .
oh , distressed , hated martyred , killed !
why , why camest now to murder , murder our solemnity ?
my daughter , and my child !
dead art thou !
oh , stop , stop , for shame !
confusion ' s cure doesn ' t cure these .
heaven and had been in this fair maid .
heaven hath won ,
and the better is it when the maid comes .
your part in her died when you could keep from death , heaven forbid his part in eternal life .
the most you sought was her , for your heaven forbid she should be advanced .
and weep , seeing as she is above the clouds , as high as heaven itself ?
yes , in this love , you love your child so ill that you , by seeing that she is well .
she doesn ' t seem well married that lives married long , but she ' s best married that dies married young .
our instruments to melancholy bells announce our wedding feast tonight .
our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change , our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse , and things bring them to the ground .
go to follow this fair corse unto her grave .
the best do lour upon you for some ill will . move them more crossing their high will .
yes , we put up our pipes and left .
ay , my dear , the case should be amended .
what a dump , we say .
come on , time to play now .
do you promise then ?
goodbye .
i will give it back to you soundly .
will you give us a chance ?
no , my faith , but the gleek .
i will show you the minstrel .
i will leave you to the serving creature .
when will i get the serving creature ' s dagger ?
i will carry crotchets .
have fun at you , my wit .
listen to me , men .
marry , sir , because hath a wife .
prates , what do you mean , james soundpost ?
yes , i know exactly what to say .
i will do everything for you .
it is " music with her silver sound " have gold for sound " .
what a pestilent knave is this !
help him , jack !
i may trust the flattering truth of sleep , my dreams presage joyful at hand .
ah !
how sweet is love itself when love ' s shadows are in joy !
verona , how now , balthasar ?
can i bring me letters from the friar ?
how is my lady ?
what is my father doing ?
how is my juliet ?
that way i can ask , for nothing can be ill if she dies .
she is very well , and can be ill .
her body lies in capels , and her immortal part with angels .
i know her in her kindred ' s vault and presently took post to tell it to you .
o , pardon me for bringing these news , since you leave it for my office , sir .
what a sick man in his will , a word ill advised to one that is ill .
in fact , cousin , i love a woman who loves a man .
what a good markman !
and she ' s fair , i swear .
a mark , coz , is soonest to hit .
in that case , miss .
she hath , and in that sparing huge waste , for example , for , starved her severity , cuts beauty off from all posterity .
she is too fair , too wise , wisely too wise , to merit bliss .
ruled me too .
think of her now .
please , teach me how to do this !
is it en so ?
i beg you , stars !
know ' st my lodging .
ink and paper , and post horses .
i will , hence .
i beseech you , sir , have mercy .
your eyes are so pale and , and do import misadventure .
tush , deceived yourself .
just leave me and do the thing i do .
hast thou received letters to me from the friar ?
good morning , my good lord .
no matter .
get out of here , and hire those .
i ' ll be with you soon .
well then , juliet , i will lie down .
don ' t see for reasons .
oh , mischief , art swift to enter in the thoughts of men !
as i remember , this house is empty .
holiday , the beggar ' s shop is closed .
oh , ho !
quiet !
who calls so loud ?
goodbye , man .
i see that poor person .
yes , there is ducats here .
art thou so naked and full of wretchedness , and fear to die ?
famine is everywhere in cheeks .
need and starveth in thine .
the world is no friend to the world ' s law .
the world affords no law to make .
buy some food , and get in flesh . , come , cordial and not poison , go with me to juliet ' s , for there must be i use .
oh , franciscan friar !
brother , listen !
this would be the voice of friar john .
come here , from mantua .
what did romeo do ?
please , if his mind writ , give me his hand .
that was my answer to mantua there was stayed .
what did my letter say , then , to romeo ?
oh , fortune !
please , brother , i ' ll go and bring it .
must i go back to the monument .
within this two hours will be fair .
i will write to mantua , and keep her at my cell until romeo comes .
oh , living corse in a dead man ' s tomb !
give me a moment , boy .
hence , and hurry .
put it out , for i would be seen .
give me those things .
as i bid , go away .
yet i will .
the one who gives something doth approach .
cursed foot wanders like this to cross my obsequies and true love ' s rite ?
hurry with a torch !
muffle , night , please .
that sounds like mattock and the wrenching iron .
i will go away , sir , and trouble you .
so thou shalt show me .
take that back .
youth , tempt a desperate man to stay .
go and leave me alone .
think not upon these matters .
let them affright themselves .
i beseech thee , please , put another sin upon my head by urging me to rage .
quiet , be quiet !
please , be gone .
live , and hereafter say a man ' s mercy bid run .
i can defy commination and apprehend for a felon here .
provoke me ?
have fun , boy !
oh lord , they killed them !
i will call the watch right away .
the tomb .
mercutio ' s kinsman , noble paris .
what said my man , when my betossed soul attend him when we rode ?
i think he told me he wanted me to marry juliet .
does he not so ?
am i dreaming about it so ?
i ' ll bury thee in a tomb .
what a name ?
oh , goodbye .
a lantern , slaughtered youth , for here lies juliet , and her beauty like this as a feasting full of light .
death , that hath sucked the honey of breath , hath had no power yet .
thou art conquered .
o , what more favor can i do to help , than with that hand that cut youth in to sunder his that was thine enemy ?
shall i believe that unsubstantial death is amorous , and that the abhorred monster keeps here in order to be his paramour ?
here , come here , here will i remain worms that are maids .
will i set up my everlasting rest , and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world - wearied flesh .
come on , look at your face .
come here , take your embrace .
drugs are faster than quick .
thus with a smile , i do .
these masks that kiss fair ladies ' eyebrows , being black , makes us look in they hide the fair .
saint francis , my dear saint francis !
how oft have my old feet stumbled at graves ! , aren ' t there ?
don ' t be one , a friend , and one that you well know .
bliss on you !
tell me , my friend , what torch is yond that lends his light to grubs and eyeless skulls ?
i can discern no , it burneth in the capels monument .
is it possible ?
goodbye .
how long hath he stayed there ?
yes , full half an hour .
go with me to the vault .
yes , sir .
goodbye , then .
i won ' t go .
come upon me .
yes , i like some ill unthrifty thing .
as i did under this yew tree , i dreamt my master and killed him .
oh , romeo ! , alack , alack , what blood is this , which the stony sepulcher ?
oh , friar !
is my lord dead ?
i can do well i should be , and there i am .
what is my romeo doing ?
i hear noises .
yes , that nest of death , contagion , and unnatural sleep .
a greater power than we contradict thwarted our intentions .
go away .
in bosom there lies dead bodies , and paris too .
come on , i ' ll dispose of a sisterhood of holy nuns .
what a fool , shut up in my true love ' s name ?
poison , i see , hath been his timeless end . , come , drink , and left friendly drop to help me after ?
i will kiss your lips .
haply some poison doth hang on them , to make me die like a man .
yea , right ?
i ' ll brief everyone .
look happy dagger , this is sheath .
go there and let me know .
this is the same .
there , let the doth burn .
the ground is bloody too . , the churchyard .
pathetic !
lies the county slain , and juliet , warm and newly dead , who here hath lain these two days buried . , come , tell the prince .
go to the capulets .
wake up , the montagues .
go find some others .
aren ' t romeo ' s man .
we found him in the churchyard .
let him come in till the prince come hither .
here is a friar that trembles , and weeps .
we know about this mattock and this spade from him he was from this churchyard ' s side .
a great victory .
the friar wants too .
what is so important about that calls our person from our morning rest ?
what should it be like that is shrieking ?
the people in the street cry " romeo , " some " juliet , " and all run with open outcry our monument .
go , seek , and know how this murder happened .
oh heavens !
oh , look how fast our daughter bleeds !
this dagger hath mista en , for , dear , his house is empty on the back of montague , and it mis - sheathed in my bosom .
o !
this of death is as loud as a bell , that my old to a sepulcher .
alas , my liege , my wife is already dead .
of course , of my son ' s exile she breathes .
what further woe conspires against yourself ?
look , and see .
seal up the mouth of outrage like a , till we can clear these ambiguities and know their spring , their head , and then will i general of your woes , and lead you even to death .
forbear , and let me be slave to thee . , bring forth the parties of suspicion . , bring forth the parties of suspicion .
i am the greatest , able to do least , yet suspect , as the time and place doth make against me , of this direful .
and i both want both to impeach and purge , myself condemned and myself excused .
then just say at what know in this .
i will brief myself , for my short date of breath is so long as is a tedious .
i heard writ to romeo , that he should hither come as this , to help to take her from her borrowed grave , being the time the potion ' s force should cease .
can he say in this case ?
their deaths of course , the tidings of her death .
quiet !
please , montague , give me hand .
oh , my lord , what do you want to say to my suit ?
saying o ' t what i have said before .
my child is like a dream in the world .
she hath never seen the change of ages .
more than she are happy mothers .
and marred are those who make so early .
her name , gentle paris , makes her heart break .
this i am an accustomed feast , whereto i would have invited many a guest such as i love .
from forth the fatal loins of these two foes , a star - crossed take their life , whose misadventures piteous overthrows doth with their death bury their parents ' strife .
the fearful passage of their death - marked love and the continuance of their parents ' rage , which , but their children ' s end , is now the two hours ' traffic of our stage , the which , if you attend , what here shall strive to
such as do young men feel when well - appareled april walks on the heel of limping treads .
such delight , fresh fennel buds shall you hear this inherit at my house .
come on , sirrah , trudge fair verona .
tell them to leave out their names ?
it is true that the shoemaker meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last , the fisher with his pencil and the painter with his nets .
i sent to find those persons whose names are here , writ , and can find out what names the writing person hath here .
take new infection to eye , and the rank poison of the old will die too .
your plantain leaf is just like that .
for what , i beg ?
why , why , romeo ?
mad , but bound more than a madman is , up in prison , kept without my food , whipped and , good e ' en , good fellow .
god help me , i ' m good e ' en .
i mean , sir , you can read ?
ay , own fortune in my own .
you have learned it by book .
i pray , you can read anything you see ?
ay , i know all the letters and the language .
ye say so .
goodbye , fellow .
i want to read .
seigneur martino and his wife and daughters , county anselme and his beauteous sisters ; the lady widow of vitruvio ; seigneur placentio and his lovely nieces ; the lady widow of vitruvio ; the lady widow of vitruvio ; the lady widow of vitruvio ; the lady widow of vitruvio ; the lady widow of vitruvio .

now i ' ll tell you what you ' re asking .
my master is the great rich capulet , and if you be of the house of montagues , i come and go with a cup of wine .
oh , you merry !
this ancient of capulet ' s sups , the fair rosaline whom thou so loves with all the admired beauties of verona .
go thither , and unattainted eye compare her face with some that i shall show , and i will make no thought swan a crow .
what about my love ?
the whole world - seeing sun ne ' er saw her the world begun .
i don ' t , no such sight to be shown , but to rejoice in splendor of mine own .
where ' s my daughter ?
let her come forth to me .
now , my maidenhead year old , i bade her come here .
come here , lamb !
how now , who comes here ?
thank you .
madam , i swear .
is your will ready ?
know ' st ' s of a pretty girl .
yes , i can tell her age unto an old woman .
she ' s only fourteen .
i ' ll lay seventeen of my teeth , and yet , to my teen be it spoken , i have but , she is .
even or odd , of all days in the year , come lammas eve at shall she .
oh , susan and she , god rest christian souls ! , were an example of an example of an example of an example .
well then , susan is god .
she was good to me .
but , i said , on lammas eve at night shall she die .
that shall be her .
marry , i swear it .
since the earthquake eleven years ago , and she was weaned , i shall forget about it , of all the days of the year , upon that day .
i had wormwood to my dig , sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall .
my lord and you were not mantua . , but , as i said , when it did taste the wormwood on the nipple of my dug and felt it bitter , pretty fool , to see it tetchy and fall out with the dug !
quiet ! quoth the dovehouse .
need not , i trow , to bid me farewell .
yes , " quoth he , " dost fall upon thy face ?
and , fool , it stinted and said " ay . " this time , fool , it stinted and said " ay . " this time , fool , it said " ay . " this time , fool , it said " ay . " this time , fool , it said " ay . " this time , fool , it said " ay . " this time , fool , it said " ay . " this time , fool , it said " ay . " this time , fool , it said " ay . " this time , fool , it said "
i pray , hold peace .
yes , madam .
yet i can not choose but laugh to think it should leave crying and say " ay . " and yet , i warrant , it did seem to leave crying and say " ay . " and it bitterly did .
yes , " quoth my husband , " fall ' st upon thy face ?
wilt thou fall backward when to age .
wilt thou , jule ? " it stinted and said " ay . " and quit saying " ay . " and quit saying " ay . " and quit saying " ay . " and quit saying " ay . " and quit saying " ay . "
mark , go to his grace !
wast the prettiest babe that e ' er i nursed .
an i might live to see married , i have my reasons .
tell me , daughter juliet , how stands your husband to be married ?
it is an amazing thing that i dream of .
well , of course , of marriage .
even though you live in verona , ladies of esteem are already mothers .
my count , i was your mother only as much upon these years as you are a man .
then come in the valiant paris seeks you for his love .

no more deep will i endart your eye than your gives strength to make it fly .
i am hence to .
i beseech you , listen .
we follow . , juliet , the stays .
come on , seek happy nights to happy days .
what , shall this speech be spoken for our excuse ?
or shall we go on ?
the date is only of prolixity .
let them measure us what they will .
give me a minute .
i want for this ambling .
please , gentle romeo , we must have you .
i swear , tell me .
you have to wear shoes , nimble soles .
if i have a soul of lead so stakes to the ground i can move .
you are a very good man .
cupid ' s wings and soar with them like a bound prisoner .
i feel sore enpierced with his shaft to soar with his light feathers , and so bound , i can bound a pitch above dull woe .
love ' s too heavy to carry .
i , an we in choler , we won ' t draw .
i struck , moved .
but thou art moved to strike .
here is to stir , and to valiant is to stand up .
a dog of that nature shall not move me .
and in it , you burthen love , too great oppression for a tender thing .
is love like a thing ?
it is rough , too , too rude , and it makes thorn .
if love can rough you , be with love .
let wantons light of tickle the whole world with their heels .
oh , we burn daylight , all right !
yes , that ' s so .
we could waste our lights in lights by day .
and we ' ll get well in going to this mask , but don ' t wit to go .
what , may i ask ?
i dreamed of a dream .
and so am i .
well , what was going on ?
that dreamers always do .
in bed while they do things true .
yes , yes , i see queen mab hath been with you .
she gallops o ' er a courtier ' s nose , and then dreams he of smelling out a suit .
and sometime comes she comes with a tithe - pig ' s tail tickling a parson ' s nose as he sleeps , he of another benefice .
this is what she wants , peace , peace , peace !
this wind makes you talk of yourself , not us .
supper is over , and we shall come together .
lusty gentlemen .
yes , drum .
isn ' t potpan , that he helps take away ?
when good men shall lie all in one or two men ' s hands , and they smell unwashed too , a foul thing .
come with the joint - stools , the court - cupboard , to the plate .
good luck , save me a piece of marchpane , and , as loves me , let the rest in susan grindstone and nell . , antony and potpan ! , antony and potpan !
ay , yes , right away .
you are welcome for and called for , asked for and for , in the great .
we need to be here and there too .
cheerly boys .

his son is here , sir .

his son was only a ward for years .
yes , sir .
yes , she can teach the way to burn bright !
for i ne didn ' t see true beauty till this .
this , his name should be a montague . , what , dares the slave come hither , covered with an antic face , to fleer and scorn at our marriage ?
wherefore , storm you ?
uncle , this is a montague , our foe , a villain that is hither come in to scorn at our situation here .
is it true ?
he said , that romeo .
happy , coz .
let him go .
he calls him a portly gentleman , and , to say the truth , verona brags of him to a virtuous and well - governed youth .
i want for the wealth of all the town in my house to do him disparagement .
therefore , be patient .
take care of him .
you won ' t endure him !
why , uncle , don ' t be a hero .
go to bed , go to bed .
you are a saucy girl .
is so true , indeed ?
this trick chance to scathe you , i beg you .
you ' re contrary to me .
i ' ll leave you now . , goodbye , cheerly , my hearts !
what have saints ' lips done , and holy palmers ?
ay , come on , lips that they use in prayer .
o , please , dear saint , let me do what i do .
they come ; grant , lest thou turn to despair .
saints , even though grant for prayers ' sake .
yes , while my prayer ' s effect doesn ' t affect me .
my lips , thine , mine , my sin is purged .
have my wife the sin that they have taken .
sin lips ?
tell me , my sin .
you can kiss by book .
madam , your mother craves a word from you .
is her mother dead ?
i heard her daughter say that you withal .
i beg you , he that can lay of her shall have the chinks .
please , gentlemen , go to be gone .
we have to have a trifling banquet toward each other . , is it en so ?
i ' m not going to my room .
the first thing is our masters and us their men .
none one .
i will show you a tyrant .
the heads of the maids ?
ay , the servants of the maids , or their servants .
take it in mind what wilt thou .
they say it makes sense to feel it .
let me tell them they shall feel while i can stand , and ' tis known i am a piece of flesh .
tis well to fish .
draw thy weapon !
my naked weapon is lying on the ground .
come here , nurse .
what is gentleman doing here ?
here comes the son and old tiberio .
what ' s he doing out there ?
marry , that , i mean , petruchio .
i did not .
his name . , if he be married .
what ' s this about ?
what ' s this about ?
here comes the strangers all are .
romeo is beloved and loves again , alike bewitched by the charm of looks , but to his he must complain , and she steals love ' s sweet bait from fearful hooks .
and if she does as much in love , her means less to meet her new beloved .
lends them power , time means , to meet , tempering extremities with sweet music .
am i going forward when my heart is here ?
he is , and , on my life , hath stol n him to bed .
he fell like this and leaped this orchard wall .
come here , mercutio .
oh , i ' ll conjure !
quiet !
look , appear in the likeness of a man !
speak but one rhyme , and i swear i can .
but " ay me ! " pronounce but " love " and " dove . " speak to my gossip venus one fair word , one nickname for her purblind son and heir , young abraham cupid , he that true when king cophetua loved the beggar maid .
an if he hear , wilt not anger him .
this can only anger him .
my invocation is fair and true .
here is his love and best befits the situation .
if love can be blind , love can not hit the mark .
will he sit under a medlar tree and wish his mistress were like that kind of fruit maids call when they laugh alone . , romeo , that she were !
yes , yes , for ' tis in deed to seek him here that means not to be found .
it is the same east and is the sun .
her vestal is but sick and green , and none but fools can stop it .
cast it down !
it is , my dear .
yes , it is , my love .
oh , that she were .
she speaks , but she says nothing .
of course of that ?
tell her to discourses .
listen to me , she speaks .
two of the fairest stars in all the heavens , some business , do entreat her eyes to twinkle in their spheres till they die .
her eye in heaven , the airy region stream would stream so bright that birds would sing and think it were night .
see how she holds on to her hand .
oh , that i were a thing like that hand that i touched that cheek !
oh , romeo , romeo !
wherefore , romeo ?
but name that which is my enemy .
i will be , romeo .
what man art that , thus in , so stumblest on my counsel ?
by a way i know how to tell who i am .
what art thou , romeo , and a montague ?
the orchard walls are too high and hard to climb , and the place , considering who art , if any of my kinsmen find here .
therefore , kinsmen are stop to me .
if they do see they will murder each other .
look , sweet , and i swear i can prove against their enmity .
i would do anything for the world they saw here .
my life were ended by their hate than anything else .
know ' st thou the mask of night is on my face , else would a blush bepaint my cheek for that which hast heard me speak tonight .
love me ?
i know not to say " ay , " and i will take no word .
what shall i do ?
not swear at all .
or , if thou wilt , swear by gracious self , which is the god of my idolatry , and i ' ll believe .
my heart ' s not dear , well , swear .
despite my joy in life , i have no joy of this contract .
this bud of love , by summer ' s ripening breath , prove a beauteous flower when we get to summer ' s ripening breath .
as sweet repose and rest come to heart as that my daughter loves my daughter .
why , leave me alone so unsatisfied ?
what satisfaction can thou have ?
exchange of love ' s faithful vows for mine .
i gave mine before didst request it , and yet i gave it away .
wouldst thou withdraw it now ?
what for , love ?
but be quiet , and give it again .
and i wish for the same thing i have .
my bounty is boundless as the sea , my deep voice .
i want some inside .
dear , adieu . , anon , good news ! , montague , be true .
stay a little longer .
i will come right away .
oh , blessed , blessed !
i want afeard , being in night , all this is but a dream , too flattering to be substantial .
three words , dear romeo , and be quiet .
do not fear me .
tell us about the law of our sides .
let them go .
i will frown , and let them take it before they list .
yes , as they say .
i will write my thumb on them , which is a good thing to them , even if they bear it .
can you bite your thumb at us , sir ?
i swear , sir .
can you bite your thumb at us , sir ?
did you quarrel , sir ?
quarrel , sir ?
goodbye , sir .
will i send someone .
thrive , my soul , like a thousand good !
a thousand times the same to want light .
bondage is hoarse , and may not speak aloud , or else would i tear the cave where echo lies , and make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine , of " my romeo ! " it is my soul that sings " my romeo ! " it is my soul that sings " my romeo ! " it is my soul that sings " my romeo ! " it is my soul that sings " my romeo ! " it is my soul that sings " my romeo ! " it is my soul that sings " my romeo !

how silver - sweet lovers tongues by night , softest music to attend ears !
quiet !
my name ?
what ' s clock to me now ?
the hour of nine .
i will fail .
twenty until then .
i have forgotten why i came back .
let me stand up until remember it .
and i ' ll stay , to have to forget , forgetting any other home but this .
tis almost over .
and yet no further than a wanton ' s bird , that lets it hop a little from his hand like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves , and a silken thread plucks it back again .
i would i were a bird .
oh , sweet , i am .
yet i should kill much more than cherishing .
good night , good night !
is sweet sorrow that i shall say good until it be morrow .
dwell not upon thine eyes , in breast .
would i could be and , sweet to rest .
so will i go to my friar ' s cell , his help to crave and my dear hap to tell .
the gray - eyed morn on the frowning night , checkering the eastern clouds with streaks of light , and fleckled darkness as a drunkard reels from forth day ' s path and titan ' s fiery wheels .
now , the sun advance on his burning eye , the day to cheer and night ' s dank dew to dry , i ' ll upfill this osier cage of with baleful weeds and precious - juiced flowers .
the earth , that nature ' s mother , is dead .
and from her of divers , kind we suck on her natural bosom find , many for many virtues excellent , none but for some and yet different .
mickle is the powerful grace that lies in herbs , plants , stones and their true qualities .
for so vile that on the earth live but to the earth some special good would give .
virtue itself turns into vice , being misapplied , and vice dignified .
within the rind of this poison hath no residence and medicine power .
opposition to kings encamp them , in man as well as herbs , grace and rude will .
and the worser is just predominant , the canker death eats up that plant .
goodbye , father .
goodbye .
what tongue , sweet saluteth me ?
son , it 's a distempered head so soon to bid good morrow to bed .
don ' t care his eyes in every old man ' s eye , and where care lodges , sleep will lie .
but where unbruised with unstuffed doth cushion his limbs , there golden doth reign .
therefore earliness doth me assure thou art uproused by distemperature .
or even if not so , here i hit it right : our romeo hath not been in bed .
that last part is true .
the sweeter rest was good enough .
rosaline , where is my ghostly father ?
that ' s my son .
but where hast , then ?
i ' ll tell it to me again , then .
neither of our remedies can help and physic lies .
i bear no hatred , blessed man , for , oh , my intercession steads my foe .
tis a tangled confession , receive a jumbled absolution .
i am rich , capulet ' s daughter .
we ' ll be bound to each other in every possible way , except we marry you .
i ' ll tell you more later about when and where we met , how we fell in love , and how we exchanged promises , but now i ' m begging you to agree to marry us today .
o holy saint francis , this is a miracle !
have you not quickly upon rosaline , whom you loved so much ?
o young men with their eyes , with their hearts .
the groans you used to make are in my old ears .
there ' s a stain on your cheek from an old tear that ' s oft washed off yet .
you were ever yourself , and this sadness was , you and your sadness were for rosaline .
and you ' re changed ?
repeat this after me : you ' ll expect women to be faithful when men are so unreliable .
you scolded me for loving thy rosaline .
i scolded you obsessing about her , loving her , my student .
and you know me not bury my love .
i can not tell you to get rid of one love and replace her with another .
o , i beg you , don ' t scold me .
the other girl love me not .
oh , she very well knows that you were acting like you were in love without knowing what love means .
but , inconsistent young man , with me come .
let ' s go out here .
i ' ll be in a rush .
wisely and slowly .
those stumble and fall .
the devil of romeo be thou ?
where ' s he come home last night ?
his father ' s house .
i am not a servant .
that fair - skinned , hard - hearted hussy , rosaline is dead to torment him he insane .
tybalt , old capulet ' s nephew has a house to romeo ' s father ' s house .
i say it ' s a challenge .
romeo will not the challenge .
man knows not how to write thee a letter .
romeo will to the letter ' s writer , telling him whether he accepts the challenge .
o poor romeo !
what is he not man enough at this face with tybalt ?
what , ' tybalt ' s story ?
did he hear what ?
he ' s thin , like a dried herring without its eggs , and he ' s got his girl .
o thy flesh , flesh , you ' re pale and weak a fish .
he ' s ready for
good you both .
what did you i faked you out ?
you see us the slip , sir , the slip .
can ' t you guess what i ' m saying ?
the time .
my employer is not good as .
but he ' s better than mine .
tis well .
you speak .
gregory , how slash thy tongue .
dost thou ?
take this up , benvolio .
i ' ll not do this duel of wits .
go , going , or i ' ll declare myself the winner .
you have wild goose in one of your jokes i have in mind of mine .
was not i to you in the chase for the goose ?
if you were ever with me for anything you ' re there for the goose .
i ll bite you on the ear that joke .
no good goose , ' tis bite me .
your eyes is a bitter apple .
your humor is not a sauce .
what ' s it just the right dish for a sweet goose ?
that ' s a joke made out of leather that spreads itself thin , from the width of an inch to as fat as a yard .
i stretch my joke for that word " fat . " you that word to the word " goose , " it that you are a fat goose .
why , why , what ' s all this joking better groaning about love ?
you ' ll be sociable .
you ' ll be romeo .
oh , you ' re too late .
i have made it not short .
i had not to the deepest part of my tale , and i say nothing more on the subject .
here ' s good news .
there ' s none , a man and a woman .
hark !
i ' ll not at your service .
let me hold my fan , peter .
good gentlemen .
nay , fair lady .
is it not now ?
it ' s late than that , i tell you .
look out here !
what kind of man are you ?
i am a man , my lady , that god has made for himself to ruin .
i pray you to speak the truth .
for himself to ruin thee , he must .
gentlemen , do you not tell me where i can find young romeo ?
i can not tell you , young romeo will not be older when you find him than he was you looking for him .
i am the youngest man by that name , there is no younger , or worse .
you well .
is the well well ?
tis well taken , i believe , too .
she will be a queen !
i ' ll put it out .
have you not found out ?
why are you to your father ' s for lunch ?
let ' s hear there .
i ' ll leave you .
he looks more in one minute than he did in a whole month .
he says anything against me , i ' ll humble him , if he were stronger than he is , and twenty punks like him .
i ' ll do it myself , if i ' ll find someone who can .
that rat !
i ' ll not one of his sluts .
i ' ll not one of his punk friends carries a knife .
i ' ll do anything to please you for kicks .
if i had seen something that , i would not have been out my weapon .
let me i ' ll draw my sword as quick as any other man if i ' ll not a fight starting and the law is on my side .
now , i swear , i ' m not angry about that i ' m shaking all over .
that scoundrel !
nurse , give my lady to your lady .
i pray you , you have a good heart , and tell me i ' ll tell her that .
o lord , lord , she ' s a happy woman .
what are you to tell her , nurse ?
you ' re only paying attention to me .
friar lawrence ' s cell she ' ll make confession and married .
good morrow , good nurse .
an hour of one of my men will go to you behind the abbey wall and give you a rope ladder .
speak .
tis honest and helpful , and i ' ll leave you for your efforts .
speak .
my mistress bids me to your mistress .
god be in heaven with you .
now , sir .
what say you to my dear nurse ?
what your man hath a secret ?
what ' s you heard the saying , " two can conspire to put one away " ?
i pray you , my man is not true as steel .
o sir , my mistress is the sweetest lady .
o lord , lord , when she was a little baby , there is one nobleman in the city , a guy named paris , who would be happy claim her as his own .
i think her angry saying that paris is more handsome than you are .
but when i say , i say she is white as a sheet .
don ' t " don ' t " t say that ?
they begin with the letter " r " o ' er . " ah , you jokester , that ' s the dog ' s name .
my compliments your lady .
nay , a thousand .
hark !
i ' ll not be ready .
i am the nurse nine o ' clock .
maybe she ' ll find him .
that ' s not so .
oh , she ' s slower !
love ' s messengers ' thoughts , which fly ten faster than sunbeams .
that ' s four hours since nine o ' clock , but she ' s back .
she was not young and passionate , she ' s as fast as a ball .
if my words would bounce her to my sweet love , and his would bounce me .
but a man of old folk like they ' re already dead , sluggish , slow , fat , and colorless , like lead .
o sweet nurse , what news do you ?
what have you to him ?
send your man .
peter for me at the gate .
now , good sweet nurse , oh , lord , why do you be sad ?
if the news is sad , let me a smile on your face .
the news is good , you ' re ruining the sweet news by playing a trick with a sour face that makes me look like a sour face that makes me look like a sour face .
i am weary .
let me alone for a while .
my bones , my bones ache not much .
i thank you for your bones , and i had your bones .
aren ' t you waiting for a moment ?
what ' s you see that i ' m out of breath ?
how do you be out of breath when you have enough breath to tell me that you ' re out of breath ?
the excuse you make delay the news itself is the news itself .
what is the good bad ?
not that question .
tell me if it ' s good or bad , and i ' ll wait for the details .
tell me i can not be satisfied .
is it not good to be bad ?
tis well you have a foolish choice .
you ' ll not know how to pick a man .
dost thou ?
no , not him , though his face is more handsome than any man ' s , and his legs are prettier , and he ' s not much to speak of , and they ' re beyond compare .
he ' s not the most courteous man in the world , but , believe me , he ' s gentle as a lamb .
well , you do want .
good morrow .
have you not had lunch ?
no , i ' d had lunch .
you told me i knew nothing .
what does he say our marriage ?
what that ?
my heart is pounding so .
my back ,
believe me , i ' ll help you ' s in pain .
sweet , sweet nurse , tell me , my love romeo say ?
your love , an honorable gentleman , who is courteous , kind , handsome , handsome , where is your mother ?
where is my mother ?
why then , she ' s dead .
what else she be ?
your answer is not strange !
your love , like an honorable gentleman , is your mother ?
are you not this ?
come hither , you ' re being ridiculous !
where is this my aching bones ?
go from now , of your messages yourself .
you ' ll be such a fuss .
speak , what did romeo say ?
would you have permission out and take confession today ?
i .
go up and rush to friar lawrence ' s cell .
there ' s a husband there who ' s waiting to make you his wife .
i can not see the blood to your cheeks .
you are as bright as you hear any news .
to the church .
your love will not use it to climb up to your window it ' s dark .
speak .
i ' ll to lunch .
you , friar lawrence ' s cell .
i ' m not trying to keep the peace .
put away your sword before it to help me stop this fight .
dost thou ?
i am the word of peace i ' ll hell , all montagues , and you .
let ' s go at it coward !
your clubs and spears !
let them !
kill them down !
down upon the capulets !
down upon the montagues !
what noise ?
i am my sword .
old montague is , and he ' s waving his sword just to make me mad .
o capulet you villain !
you ' re one step toward an enemy .
no , wish me not .
pray you , dear nurse .
amen to thee .
whatever misfortunes occur , they ' ll ruin the joy i feel with one look at her .
nay , love no other in moderation .
that is the key long lasting love .
too fast is as fast as too slow .
here comes the lady .
tis a footstep as light as hers will endure the rocky road of life .
that how flimsy and unreal pleasure is .
romeo will you , my girl , of us .
i ' ll give him equal thanks , as we ' ll .
ah , juliet , if you ' re as happy as i am , and you ' ll better with words , me the happiness you imagine we ' ll have in our marriage .
i can not imagine no more than i can say i have on my mind than words .
come , come with me , and we ' ll work the job .
i ' ll leave you , good mercutio , let ' s call it a day .
you ' ll like one of those guys who walks into a bar , slams his sword on the table , and then says , " i pray i never have to use you . " the time he ordered his second drink , he pulled his sword on the bartender for reason at all .
am i one of those guys ?
come , you be as angry as any guy in italy when you ' re in the mood .
and what that ?
if there were two men like you , soon there ' s none because the two of you would kill each other .
you can not fight with a man he had one more whisker or one less whisker in his beard you have in your beard .
you ' re not fighting with a man who ' s cracking nuts because you have hazelnut - colored eyes .
you would not look for a fight that would .
your head is full of fights as an egg is full of yolk , your head has beaten scrambled eggs from so much fighting .
you say a man who coughed in the street because he woke up a dog that was sleeping in the sun .
do you argue it out with your tailor for wearing one of his new suits before the right season ?
and tying the new shoes he made with old laces ?
and yet you ' re the wants to teach me about restraint !
if i were in the fighting , the way you are , my life insurance would sky high .
what your life ?
that ' s most foolish .
o great , come the capulets .
well , well , i ' ll not .
let it together something else .
it hath a word and a blow .
you ' ll find ready enough do that , sir , if you give me a reason .
what ' s you a reason without my giving you one ?
mercutio , you go with romeo .
hang out ? you think we are , musicians in a band ?
we look like musicians to you , you would expect nothing but noise .
we ' ll talk in a public place .
go to some private place private , or talk it over rationally , or else away .
look out here see us .
men ' s eyes were made to see things , not to see them .
i ' ll not move to please anyone .
tis well , peace be with you .
here comes my man , the man i ' ll be for thee .
he ' s dead your man .
tybalt i have a reason to love you that lets put aside the rage i should feel and that insult .
i am thy villain .
tis so , then .
i can not tell that you ' re who i am .
boy , your words ' s pardon the harm you ' ve done to me .
so and draw your sword .
and so , good capulet , which is a name i love like my own name , you should know not what i say .
this is not dishonorable and vile .
what say you from me ?
will you wear your sword of its sheath ?
nay , i ' ll smack you on the ears with my sword before you have yours drawn .
i ' ll leave you .
o noble mercutio , your sword .
let ' s away , tybalt .
i ' ll hurt thee .
tis a plague of thy families .
i ' ll finish .
what did he do away clean ?
what , are you not ?
but it ' s gone .
what is my page ?
have courage not man .
the wound ' s too bad .
no , it ' s not as deep as a well , or as wide as a church door , but it ' s mine .
for me tomorrow , and you ' ll hear me in a grave .
i ' ll do thee no more in this world , i swear .
tis a plague strike your houses .
i ' ll do that dog , that rat , that mouse , that mouse , that mouse , that mouse , that mouse , that mouse , that mouse , that mouse , that mouse , that mouse , that mouse , that mouse , that mouse , that mouse , that mouse , that mouse , that mouse , that mouse
that braggart , punk villain he learned swordsmanship from a manual !
why should the hell you in between us ?
he lies from under your arm .
i heard it was the right thing to do .
let me in some house , benvolio , i ' ll out .
o a plague strike your families !
they ' ll kill me food for worms .
i ' ll not for thee .
your families !
o romeo , romeo , brave mercutio is dead !
here comes the merciless tybalt back .
what he ' s alive and victorious , and mercutio dead ?
either you , or i , or both of us have him .
wretched boy , you hung out with him , and you ' ve been to heaven with him .
this will not who dies .
come , romeo , out here .
the citizens are gone , and tybalt is gone .
aren ' t stand there stunned .
the prince will not give you the death penalty you caught .
o so of thee here !
are you not waiting ?
the man hath killed mercutio , which he go ?
tybalt , that murderer , which he hath ?
tybalt is not lying there .
good morrow , nephew .
were you not here when it came ?
where are the evil men of this battle ?
oh , noble prince , i can not tell you the unfortunate circumstances of this deadly battle .
he sends your relative , brave mercutio , and young romeo with him .
tybalt was , my lord !
he was my brother son !
cousin cousin !
what benvolio , this fight ?
o romeo cried out , my friends .
break it up . " then he in between them and them put their swords down .
i can not break up the fight , tybalt was slain .
romeo when tybalt fell dead .
benvolio is the most montague family .
he ' s telling the truth .
there were twenty montagues fighting in this dreadful riot , and those twenty kill one man .
you , prince , are the first to give me justice .

romeo , tybalt .
what should the price be for mercutio ' s life ?
his crime hath justice ' t taking tybalt ' s life .

i ' ll send my eyes to prison , and they ' ll be free look at anything again .
i ' ll not my vile body to the earth .
tybalt , tybalt he was the best friend i had .
i would i had long enough to see him die .
has not romeo been killed , and is tybalt dead ?
tybalt was not my cousin .
tybalt is dead , and romeo has gone .
god save romeo ' s hand shed tybalt ' s blood ?
it did not , it did .
curse not the day this , but it comes .
oh , he ' s a serpent disguised as a flower .
what a dragon hide in such a beautiful cave ?
he ' s a raven of the dove .
oh , nature , were you not in hell ?
was there such an evil book as a lovely cover ?
come , where ' s my servant ? , give me some brandy . , these griefs , these sorrows , old .
on thy romeo !
i sores cover your tongue for a wish that thou !
he was to be ashamed .
he ' ll honor thee , complete honor .
i was not a beast to be angry at him .
are you not saying good things about the man who killed your cousin ?
what , do you villain , do you kill my cousin ?
my cousin the villain would not have killed my husband .
all this is not news .
what , then , i cry ?
i would not be glad about it , but it weighs on my like sins linger in thy guilty minds .
tybalt is dead , and romeo has banished thee .
that banishment is not the end of ten thousand tybalts .
tybalt ' s death be bad if that was .
it have been if , after she said , " tybalt ' s dead , " she said to me my mother or my father , or both , were gone .
but to say that tybalt ' s dead and then say , " romeo has been banished . " say that is saying that my father , my mother , tybalt , romeo , romeo , juliet have all been killed .
romeo has banished thee . that news infinite death .
words do not express the pain .
where are my father and my mother , then ?
they are gone and over tybalt ' s corpse .
what are you going to join them ?
i ' ll lead you there .
who are they out of his wounds , their tears ?
i ' ll cry my tears for romeo ' s banishment their tears are dry .
this rope ladder .
he says this rope ladder to be a highway to my bed , but i am a virgin , and i will not a virgin and a widow .
and death , not thy romeo , my heart !
to your bedroom .
i ' ll find thee thy romeo comfort you .
i know not where he is .
your romeo will not be here tonight .
i ' ll not to him .
he ' s in friar lawrence ' s cell .
romeo , speak .
out of you frightened man .
why , father ' s the news ?
you too much suffering .
i have news for you the prince ' s punishment .
is the prince ' s punishment so terrible doomsday ?
what , banishment ?
be merciful and say " thy death . " exile is death .
" from now , you are banished from verona .
you should not endure this because the world is broad and wide .
there is none world for the walls of verona , except purgatory , torture , and hell itself .
to be banished from verona is being banished from the world , and banished from the world is not death .
thou calling death banishment is cutting off my head with a golden ax and smiling i ' m being murdered .
o deadly sin !
o most rude and unthankful boy !
it ' s no torture , mercy .
flies are healthier and honorable and suits for romance romeo .
flies can not kiss her , i think the city .
flies are like free men , i have heard .
and you say that exile is death ?
do you have no poison , no sharp knife , no weapon you use to kill me quickly , so disgraceful , except banishment ?
friar , thou damned souls the word banishment to hell .
they say not about banishment .
you ' re a member of a divine spiritual order of men who forgive sins , and you say you ' re my friend , how you have the heart to mangle me with the word banishment ?
you foolish madman , to tell me a tale .
your servants were fighting against your enemy ' s servants , i am sure .
i am my sword part with them .
as we were trading blows , more and more people showed up to join the fight , till the prince came and came .
where ' s thy romeo ?
have you not seen him ?
i ' ll be glad he ' s here for this fight .
i went with him , he saw me coming and in the woods .
he ' ll seen there many mornings crying tears that add drops to the morning dew and making a cloudy day cloudier with his sighs .
but as long as the sun rises in the west , my sad son home to escape the light .
oh , you ' re going to talk about banishment again .
do not say anything else .
oh , madmen like you are not deaf .
how should madmen hear , if wise men don ' t see ?
tell me not to you about your situation .
you ' re talking about something that you don ' t feel .
if you were as young as i am , if you were in love with juliet , if you had married her an hour ago , if you were lovesick like me , and if you were banished , then you might murder tybalt , if you were lovesick like me .
up .
here ' s knocking .
good morrow , good romeo .
i ' ll not hide all the mist from my heartsick groans groans groans envelopes me like fog and conceals me from people ' s searching eyes .
where are you knocking hard ?
where do you come from ?
what do you want ?
o , holy friar , where is my lady ' s husband ?
what ' s romeo ?
oh , he doesn ' t just like juliet , just like her .
o painful sympathy !
she ' s on the ground like him , blubbering and weeping , weeping and blubbering .
stand up if you ' ll be a man .
for juliet ' s sake , for her sake , and mine .
what should you into so deep a moan ?
hark !
o sir , sir .
tis well death is the end for thee .
were you about juliet ?
how is she now ?
is she not ?
how is she now ?
my secret wife say our ruined love ?
she ' s calling out my name as if i were a bullet murdering her relative , i murdered her relative .
what , friar , in part of my body is my name imbedded ?
let me , i cut it out of myself .
why are you a ?
your wild temper the irrational fury of a beast .
you have done me .
i pray by my holy order , i pray you were not smarter and more rational than this .
what have you tybalt ?
do you complain your birth , the heavens , and the earth ?
you have so much natural talent , but someone hoards money , you use of your talent for the right purpose , not your body , not your love , not your love , not your love , not your love , not your love , not your love , not your love , not your love , not your love , not your love , not your love , not your love , not your love , not your love , not your love , not your love , not your love , not your love , not your love , not your love , not your love , not your love , not your love , not your love , not your love , not your love , not your love , not your love , not your love , not your love , not your love , not your love , not your love , not your love , not your love , not your love , not your love , not your love , not your love , not your love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love , not their love
get up , man !
your juliet is gone .
tybalt to kill you , if you tybalt .
tis happy that you ' re alive .
you have the best sorts of happiness enjoy .

to her bedroom and comfort her .
give my regards to your lady , and her hurry in the house to bed .
romeo is gone .

hurry up , it ' s late .
this time i feel so much better !
come now of here .
good night .
nothing depends on this : be out here before the night watchmen take their positions , or in disguise after daybreak .

i ' ll find your servant , and he ' ll update you now and then on your case till it here .
give me thy hand .
it ' s late .

things have gone out so unluckily , sir , that we ' ve had time to convince our daughter to marry you .

these times of pain are not for romance .
madam , good morrow .

tell her my son paris ' s love for her .
and tell her , tell me , on wednesday , what day is tuesday ?
good morrow , my lord .
hark !
ha !
dost you think it ' s a good rush ?
we ' ll have too large a celebration , we invite a friend or two .
nay , because tybalt was just killed , people might think that we ' d care about his memory as our relative if we have too grand a party .
therefore we ' ll have half a dozen friends to the wedding , and that ' s it .
what do you think wednesday ?
my lord , i thursday were tomorrow .
fare thee well home .
it is done , then .
are you mad ?
it ' s a long time till dawn .
that sound you were the one it was the lark , the nightingale that at first dawn , the nightingale .
my love , are those streaks of light in the clouds parting in the west ?
good night is , and day is done .
that light is not daylight , i fear it .
it ' s meteor out of the sun to light your way to mantua .
stay not for a while .
you ' ll have time to go yet .
let me be captured .
let me put thee to death .
i am content , if that ' s the way you say it .
i can not stay no longer i want to go .
o , death , and death !
here ' s another .
it ' s daylight .
it is so .
it ' s the lark that out of tune , making such harsh noise .
the lark hath a sweet division between night and night .
it ' s true because she can not separate us .
and yet more light .
and more for thee .
speak .
dost thou ?
your bed is to your bedroom .
good day .
the window lets no day in , and out the window goes .
o farewell , farewell !
give me one kiss , and then i ' ll .
he lies himself up in his bedroom , shuts his windows to keep out the beautiful daylight , and himself an artificial night .
my noble uncle , do you know what he did do this ?
i don ' t know , and he didn ' t tell me .
have you heard you could not to make him tell you the reason ?
i hope you ' re not lucky to hear the true story by sticking around .

madam , i am not well .
will you go to your cousin ' s death forever ?
are you sure of him out of his grave with tears ?
if you , you ' ll bring him back to life .
so cry not .
tis a little bit grief for a man of love .
let me weep for a great loss .
you will not feel the loss , the man you weep for will .
the loss this , i can ' t help but weep for him forever .
well , girl you ' re weeping not for his death as much as for the fact that the villain who killed him is still alive .
villain , madam ?
that villain , romeo .
that ' s the murderer .
nay , madam , he is beyond my reach .
i say that one can not avenge my cousin ' s death except me !
weeping .
i would send a man mantua , where that exiled rogue is living .
and , i hope , you ' ve satisfied .
i ' ll not be satisfied with romeo i see him .
madam , if you can not find a man to deliver the poison , i ' ll mix it myself that romeo will not sleep soon after he drinks it .
i take the love i had for my cousin and take it out on the body of the man killed him .
go out the way , and i ' ll take the right man .
but i have been joyful news with you , girl .
and it wouldst have joy in such a joyless time .

she ' s dead , she ' s dead , she ' s dead !
hark !
let me see her .
oh !
she ' s cold .
her blood has , and her joints are cracked .
she ' s dead for some time .
she ' s gone , a beautiful flower , killed by an unseasonable frost .
o sad day !
this is a most painful time !
death , which has taken her away to make me cry , ties up my tongue and ' let me speak .
what , is the bride go to church ?
she ' s ready to go , but she ' ll not return .
thy death is my son in law .
is not my heir .
my daughter hath died .
i will not die and leave thee .
thy life , wealth , death .
have i not long to see this morning , only to see this ?
o accursed , wretched , hateful hateful hateful !
this is the most most hour of all !
i had one child , one poor and loving child , the one thing i had to rejoice and comfort myself , and cruel death has it me !
o pain !
o painful , painful , painful , painful !
there has not been so black a day as last .
o painful day , painful day !
she was not divorced , wronged , spited , spited , !

o love !
o life !
there is no life , my love is gone !
o , distressed , hated martyred !
why did not this have now ?
o my soul and my child !
you are dead !
nay , for shame !
the noise for confusion is screaming and screaming .
you had this child when the world of heaven .
heaven has sent her .
she is not in a place .
you know not her dying day , but heaven will give her eternal life .
the most you hope for was for her to marry poor and rise up the social ladder that was your of heaven .
and do you , though she has risen up above the clouds , as high as heaven itself ?
nay , in this love , you love your child so badly , that you are mad , though she is in heaven .
it is not marry well and young , better than to be married for a long time .
our wedding banquet will be like a burial feast .
our celebratory hymns will not be sad funeral marches .
take this lovely corpse to her grave .
don ' t disturb the heavens more by trying to go against heaven ' s will .
well , we put away our pipes and home .
no , well , better .
nay , a sad song .
it ' s not the proper time to play .
did you ' t , then ?
speak .
i ' ll give it to you .
will you not give us leave ?
no money i .
i ' ll tell you a minstrel .
i ' ll tell you a serving - creature .
i ' ll tell you on the head with the serving - creature ' s knife .
i ' ll sing you to sing .
hear you not ?
let me be men .
tis well , sir silver has a sweet sound .
o studpid answer !
what do you say , james well , i ' ll hear what to say .
i ' ll not for you .
it is " with her silver sound , " musicians have gold to use to make noises .
an annoying man , this is not !
let him , jack !
if i do trust my dreams , some joyful news is coming .
my lord !
how sweet it would be to have the woman i love , when about thy love makes me so happy .
you have news from verona ! , is it not balthasar ?
do you bring me a letter from the friar ?
how is my lord ?
where is my father ?
how is my lord ?
i know that again can not be wrong if she is well .
then she is well , and is not ill .
her body in the capulet tomb , and her immortal soul the angels in heaven .

am i that death is in love with you , and that the awful monster keeps you to be his mistress ?
nay , i ' ll not with worms that are your chamber - maids .

where is this blood that the stony entrance of this tomb ?
o friendly friar !

i am very well where i should be , and yet i am not .
where is my romeo ?
i hear not noise .
o lady , of the tomb .
tis a greater power than we can fight has our hearts .
come , away .
your husband hath been dead there , and paris .
nay , i ' ll tell you the sisterhood of holy nuns .
did it not open a cup , locked in my true love ' s hand ?
poison i , hath the cause of his death .
i will not kiss your lips .
there is some poison on them , to make me die with a medicinal kiss .
what noise , noise ?
i ' ll not be quick .
o good morrow , a knife !
by my body and let me die .
this is the last .
there comes the torch is burning .
the ground is soft .
this is a pitiful tale !
nay , the prince .
to the capulets .
go up the montagues .
have some more others .
' tis romeo ' s man .
we call him in the churchyard .
hold him in custody until the prince here comes here .
is a friar ' s trembling , sighing and weeping .
we think this pickax and this shovel from him , he was from this side of the graveyard .
tis suspicious .
the friar hath too .
what crimes do thou murder so early in the morning that i have to wake before the time ?
what ' s the matter , that they cry out so loud ?
some people in the street are crying " romeo . " some are crying " juliet , " and some are crying " paris . " some are crying " paris . " some are crying " paris . " some are crying " paris . " some are crying " paris . " some are crying " paris . " some are crying " paris . " some are crying " paris . " some are crying " paris . " some are crying " paris . " some are crying " paris . "
how much this foul murder about .
heavens !
oh , thy wife , how our daughter bleeds !
that knife should be in its sheath on that montague ' s back , but it ' s - sheathed in my daughter ' s breast .
my lord !
this sight of death is a bell that warns me i ' ll die .
my liege , my wife hath died tonight .
over my son ' s exile , let her be .
what pain must i endure in my old age ?
look , and you ' ll find .
and i ' ll not be the leader of pain , and i ' ll lead you as far as death .
in the meantime , on , and be patient .
i am the greatest , but i was not to do the work .
i have condemned thee and myself .
tell us you do not know about this affair .
i will be brief because i ' m going to live long enough to tell a boring story .
in the meantime i wrote to romeo and told him to come to here on this awful night to help remove her from her temporary grave when the sleeping potion worn off .
i know not of this .
i am my wife of juliet ' s death .
let me read the letter .
brother , brother montague give me your hand .
but do you say to my request ?
i repeat what i ' ll say before .
my daughter is not young .
she ' s not twelve years old .
older than she marry and be happy mothers .
not girls marry so young too soon .
and charm her , gentle paris ; make her love you not .
tomorrow i ' ll be a feast that we ' ve celebrated for many years .
at my humble house tonight , you may see dazzling stars that walk on the ground and light the sky from above .
in the most beautiful city of verona , where our story takes place a long - standing hatred between two families erupts into violence , and citizens their hands with the blood of their fellow citizens .
tis unlucky children of these enemy families , lovers and suicide .
their deaths make an answer to their parents ' feud .
along with me .
the name whose names are on this list ?
it is not that shoemakers and tailors play with each other ' s tools , that fisherman should play with paints , and painters play with fishing nets , and painters play with fishing nets .
but i ' ve been sent to find the people whose names are written on this list , and i ' ll read thee !
come some people , in the nick of time .
you must cut your shin .
dost thou ?
what romeo , are you mad ?
i ' ll go in a prison and deprived of food .
i ' ll be whipped and tortured may god give you a good night .
what , sir , you know not how to read ?
i can not read my own fortune in my sleep .
you ' re learned from life and from books .
but tell me , what do you see ?

have not a day !
the most beautiful rosaline whom you love so much will not capulet ' s traditional feast , with every beautiful woman in verona .

you know not how young my daughter is .
i know not her age down to the hour .
she ' s not twelve .
i ' d bet thee twelve of my own teeth , but , i ' m sorry to say , i have four teeth , she ' s not fourteen .
whether it ' s even or odd , of all the days in the year , on the night of lammas eve , she ' s twelve .
she and susan , god rest her and all christian souls , were at the day .
for susan died and is with god .
she was not good with me .
i said , the night of lammas eve , she will not be sixteen .
nay , she will not .
indeed , i know it not .
it ' s eleven years since the earthquake .
i had bitter wormwood on my breast i was in the sun , under the wall of the dovehouse .
but i said not , when she tasted the bitter wormwood on my nipple , the pretty little babe annoyed and to quarrel with my breast .
the dovehouse hath with the earthquake .
there was no need to tell me to out of there .
what , " he said , " you fall on your face ?
you ' ll not do this .
please be silent .
good morrow , madam .
but i ' m still laughing to think that the baby stopped crying and said , " yes . " i swear , she had a bump on her forehead as big as a rooster ' s testicle .
it was a most painful bruise , and she was not .
what , " said my husband , you fall on your face ?
you ' ll fall backward when you grow up , won ' t you , jule ? " and she said , " yes . " and she said , " yes . " and she said , " yes . " and she said , " yes . " and she said , " yes . " and she said , " yes . " and she said , " yes . " and she said , " yes . " and she said , " yes . " and she said , " yes . " and she said , " yes . " and she said , " yes . " and she said , " yes .

god may choose you receive his grace .
you were the prettiest i nursed .
i live not to see you get married someday , my wishes will be true .
tell me , my daughter , is your attitude getting married ?
it is an honor that i do dream of .
tis well , about marriage now .
in verona there are girls younger than you , girls from noble families , have become mothers .
by my count , i was your mother at about your age , while you a virgin .
well then , i ' ll do this : the valiant paris you as his bride .
tis a man of young lady .
summertime in verona has no flower as he .
lose thee ?
i ' ll not look at him and try like him , at if what i see is likable .
but i ' ll not myself fall for him any more than your permission allows .
nothing ' s out of order .
follow thou straight after me .
we ' ll leave you .
o girl , for a man who ' ll give you happy nights at the end of happy days .
will we not say is our excuse being here ?
what should we enter for apologizing ?
it ' s out of fashion to give lengthy explanations that can not .
let them judge us if they please .
give me thy hand .
i ' ll not want to dance .
no , noble romeo , you ' ve got .
leave me , tell me .
you ' ll be dancing shoes , nimble soles .
my soul is made out of lead , and it isn ' t so heavy it makes me stuck on the ground so i can ' t move .
you ' ll be a lover .
cupid ' s wings and fly the average man .
his arrow hath pierced me too deeply , i ' ll fly high with his cheerful feathers .
i am the heavy weight of love .
we ' ll take their trash .
i hit hard i ' ll be angry .
to run away .
you ' ll not stand and fight .
tis a dog from that house will be angry to take a stand .
you can not sink , you ' ll love down .
is thy love tender ?
i fear it ' s too rough , too rude , and it pricks a thorn .
if love rough with you , play rough with thee come , let ' s knock and go in .
tis playful people with light hearts .
nay , we ' re wasting precious daylight .
o let ' s !
no , we ' ll not , it ' s night .
we mean well by going to this masquerade ball , but it ' s smart of us to go .
what , i ask thee ?
i had a dream of night .
so do i .
well was your dream ?
my dream me that dreamers lie .
they in bed they dream about the truth .
oh , i pray you ' ve been with who ' s queen mab ?
she rides over a courtier ' s lips , and he makes money off of someone .
she ' s a priest ' s nose , a fine enough , enough !
mercutio , come .
the wind you ' re blowing is blowing us off our course .
dinner is over , and we ' ll go there too late .
o thy lover boys !
the drum .
what ' s potpan ?
only one or two men have all the good manners , and even they are dirty , are they not .
to the stools , the sideboards , and the plates .
pray you , good friend , save me a piece of marzipan , and you , have the porter in susan grindstone and nell .
nay , boy , i ' ll be ready .
they ' ll leave for you in the great chamber .
we ' ll be in two places at once , both here and there !
good morrow , boys .
quick for a while and the who lives the longest take everything .
good morrow , gentlemen .
you ' ll not be shy , i ' ll swear she has corns .
good morrow , gentlemen .
i pray thee , it must be forty years .
it ' s been longer , it ' s longer .
lucentio ' s son is not that , sir .
he ' s forty years old .
are you to tell me that ?
his son was not a minor two years .
i ' ll know thee , sir .
oh , she doth the torches how to burn bright !
my eyes were liars , then , because i saw true beauty tonight .
i am by his voice that this man is a montague .
why are you not angry ?
uncle , this man is not a montague our enemy .
is it not , romeo ?
that hath him , that villain romeo .
down , gentle cousin .
let him alone .
he himself looks like a dignified gentleman , and , to tell you the truth , he has a most extensive history throughout verona as a virtuous and well behaved young man .
i can not insult him in my own house for all the wealth in this town .
not so down .
ignore him not .
i ' ll tolerate him not .
you but , uncle , we ' ll .
go , go , go .
you ' re an insolent boy .
is that how it is done , then ?
i know not what i ' ll do .
do you have to contradict me , do you ?
i ' ll teach you a way .
what ' s saints and pilgrims have lips too ?
nay , pilgrim , they have lips that they ' ll want to pray with .
nay , saint , let thy lips know what hands do .
grant my prayer so my faith wouldst not turn to despair .
saints ' move , when they grant thy prayers .
aren ' t move while i act out my prayer .
my sin has not taken from my lips by .
my lips have not the sin they took from yours ?
o sin , my lips ?
give me my sin .
you kiss you ' re studied how .
madam , your mother to you .
where is her mother ?
i nursed her daughter , whom you were to .
let me tell you , the man marries her will not be rich .
no gentlemen , ' tis ready to go now .
we have not a dessert up .
you ' ll be right .
the fight is ours masters , and we men for them .
it ' s the same .
i ' ll not be a harsh master to them .
off their heads ?
you see their cut off their heads , take their maidenheads .
my remark in sense you do not like .
the women you rape are the ' ll have " sense " it .
i ' ll give a nice piece of flesh .
it ' s a good idea you ' re not a piece of fish .
you ' ll be out of your tool now .
i have put my naked sword on .
come , nurse .
what is that gentleman ?
he is not the son and old tiberio .
who ' s the ' s going out of the door right now ?
that one , i , am young petruchio .
i ' ll not know his name .
ask thee .
what ' s this ?
what ' s this ?
the strangers are all gone .
but he hath his speeches of love to a woman who ' s supposed to be his enemy .
and juliet ' s as much in love as he , but she has no more opportunity to meet her lover .
but love gives them no power , and time gives them the meet , sweetening the extreme danger with extreme pleasure .
did i go away my heart stays here ?
i heard he slipped away and home to bed .
he fell over this and jumped over this orchard wall .
let him come , mercutio .
i ' ll conjure him if i were not summoning a spirit .
hark !
show in the form a sigh .
speak not one rhyme , and i ' ll die .
just cry out , " ah me ! " and " dove . "
he hears you , you ' ll make him angry .
what i ' m saying ' s anger against him .
the last i ' m saying are fair and honest .
his love is blind , it in the dark .
love is blind , it ' ll hit the target .
he ' ll not sit under a let ' s .
there ' s no point in looking for him if he didn ' t want to be found .
it is not the east and is the sun .
thy virgin hath her sick and green .
it goes .
there ' s my lady !
nay , it is my love .
i wish she knew not how much i love her .
she ' s talking , but she ' s nothing .
what now ?
her eyes are not something .
she ' s speaking to me .
two of the brightest stars in the whole sky had to go away on business , and now they ' re her eyes twinkle in their places till they return .
if her eyes were in the night sky , they would shine so brightly through space that birds would singing singing with thinking her light was the light of day .
look how she puts her hand upon her cheek .
oh , i was the glove on that hand so that i could not touch that cheek .
o , my lord !
are you mad ?
i am my name , dear saint , my voice is your enemy .
what ' s you , romeo ?
and ' tis you a montague ?
tell me , how did you in here ?
and why should you come ?
if any of my relatives find you here they ' ll kill you who you are .
your relatives are not obstacle .
they say you , they ' ll murder you .
at me kindly , and i ' ll be invincible against their hate .
i ' ll give thee anything to them seeing you here .
i ' d rather they kill me have live without your love .
otherwise , you wouldn ' t see blushing about the things you ' ve heard me say tonight .
do you love me ?
i pray you ' ll say " no , " and i ' ll believe you .
what am i sworn ?
don ' t swear at all .
you have sworn , swear by your wonderful self , which is the god i worship like an idol , and then i ' ll believe you .
if my heart ' s thy dear love , well ' ll swear .
you bring me no joy , i ' ll take joy in this exchange of promises tonight .
our love , which right now is like a flower bud in the summer air , may not be a beautiful flower by the next time we meet .
i pray you , the sweet peace and rest i feel in my heart .
oh , are you not leaving me unsatisfied ?
what satisfaction do you have tonight ?
i am my love to you , you asked me to .
i would i could take that promise back , so i had it to give again .
do you take it back ?
why do you know that , my love ?
be most generous and give it to you more .
but i ' m glad for something i have .
my generosity you is as limitless as the sea , and my heart is deep .
i hear not a door .
sweet montague , come .
come here for a time .
i ' ll back .
o blessed night , blessed night !
because it ' s dark out , i don ' t know all this is just a dream , too sweet to be real .
three words , dear romeo , and it ' s good night for thee .
don ' t fret about me .
i can not let ' s break the law beginning a fight .
let them begin .
i ' ll frown at them as they pass by , and then they react they .
you mean they dare not .
i ' ll bite my thumb to them .
what are you biting your thumb at us ?
i ' ll draw my thumb .
where are you your thumb at us ?
why are you to a fight ?
a fight ?
good morrow , sir .
i ' ll send thee the messenger .
by my soul it , a thousand good night .
tis leaving you is a thousand times worse near you .
oh , i would i could make a soul call out my name .
the lovers calling each other names through the night is silver - tempered .
hark !
where my hawk ?
what time tomorrow i am a messenger to you ?
o ' clock .
i ' ll fail thee .
now then again like twenty years .
i have not i called you back .
let me stand with you remember your reason .
i ' ll do that i have any home except this spot .
it ' s morning .
he sings the bird hop a little from his hand and yanks him by a string .
i am not your bird .
my sweet , i do not .
but i can not kill you petting you too much .
good night , good night .
parting is such sweet sorrow that i ' ll say good night tomorrow .
i hope you can not peacefully .
i would i were sleep and peace , i would spend the night with you .
i ' ll not see my priest , to ask for his help and tell him about my good luck .
darkness is of the sun ' s path a drunk man .
nay , before the sun comes up and burns away the dew , i have this basket of mine with poisonous weeds and medicinal flowers .
upon the earth is nature ' s mother and nature ' s tomb .
from the earth ' s womb , different sorts of plants and animals come forth , and the earth her children many excellent forms of nourishment .
for herbs , plants , and stones .
there is nothing on earth that is so evil that it provide the earth with some quality .
virtue to th ' vice it ' misused .
the little rind of this weak flower there is not poison and powerful medicine .
there are none elements in thee , in men as well as in herbs , good and evil .
thy evil is dominant , death the body like cancer .
farewell , good father .
god save you .
who greets me early in the morning ?
young man , ' tis wrong if you ' re getting out of bed this early .
every old man has worries , and worried men never get any sleep , young men ' ll have a care in the world .
they go to bed early and plenty of sleep .
therefore , the fact that you ' ve been awake this early tells me you ' ve been upset with some anxiety .
if that not the case , then this must not be the answer : you , romeo , have been to bed tonight .
your last guess is well .
i am not a sweeter than sleep .
what , rosaline father ?
that ' s all , my boy .
but have not you been ?
i ' ll tell you again you have asked me again .
you have heard the sacred cure both of us .
i can not carry no hatred , holy man , my will my enemy .
