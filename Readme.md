# TSTBench

Codes for "TSTBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Text Style Transfer"
The framework is built on an extensible modular-based codebase, comprising an input module, a transfer module, as well as an evaluation and analysis module. Currently, we have incorporated 13 SOTA methods on TST and multiple visual analysis tools. 

* Datasets

  Follow DATASET.md to download datasets and then run prepareall.py.

* Algorithms

  We reproduce several algorithms, and we cite the paper and repos. We present running environment and settings in each of them.

* Evaluation

  Download our pretrained evaluation model and follow EVALUATION.md to get the evaluation results.

* Ananlysis

  We provide outputs and the analysis code, follow ANALYSIS.md.
